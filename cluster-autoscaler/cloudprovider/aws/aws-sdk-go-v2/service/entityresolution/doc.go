// Package entityresolution provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWS EntityResolution.
//
// Welcome to the Entity Resolution API Reference.
//
// Entity Resolution is an Amazon Web Services service that provides
// pre-configured entity resolution capabilities that enable developers and
// analysts at advertising and marketing companies to build an accurate and
// complete view of their consumers.
//
// With Entity Resolution, you can match source records containing consumer
// identifiers, such as name, email address, and phone number. This is true even
// when these records have incomplete or conflicting identifiers. For example,
// Entity Resolution can effectively match a source record from a customer
// relationship management (CRM) system with a source record from a marketing
// system containing campaign information.
//
// To learn more about Entity Resolution concepts, procedures, and best practices,
// see the [Entity Resolution User Guide].
