// Package serverlessapplicationrepository provides the API client, operations,
// and parameter types for AWSServerlessApplicationRepository.
//
// The AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers and
// enterprises to quickly find and deploy serverless applications in the AWS Cloud.
// For more information about serverless applications, see Serverless Computing and
// Applications on the AWS website.
//
// The AWS Serverless Application Repository is deeply integrated with the AWS
// Lambda console, so that developers of all levels can get started with serverless
// computing without needing to learn anything new. You can use category keywords
// to browse for applications such as web and mobile backends, data processing
// applications, or chatbots. You can also search for applications by name,
// publisher, or event source. To use an application, you simply choose it,
// configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks.
//
// You can also easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the
// community at large, or privately within your team or across your organization.
// To publish a serverless application (or app), you can use the AWS Management
// Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs to upload the code.
// Along with the code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known as the AWS
// Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template. For more information about AWS
// SAM, see AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) on the AWS Labs GitHub
// repository.
//
// The AWS Serverless Application Repository Developer Guide contains more
// information about the two developer experiences available:
//
//   - Consuming Applications – Browse for applications and view information about
//     them, including source code and readme files. Also install, configure, and
//     deploy applications of your choosing.
//
// Publishing Applications – Configure and upload applications to make them
//
//	available to other developers, and publish new versions of applications.
