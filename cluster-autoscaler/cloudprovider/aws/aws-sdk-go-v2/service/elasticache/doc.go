// # Amazon ElastiCache
//
// Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate,
// and scale a distributed cache in the cloud.
//
// With ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of a high-performance,
// in-memory cache with less of the administrative burden involved in launching and
// managing a distributed cache. The service makes setup, scaling, and cluster
// failure handling much simpler than in a self-managed cache deployment.
//
// In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get enhanced
// visibility into the key performance statistics associated with their cache and
// can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.
