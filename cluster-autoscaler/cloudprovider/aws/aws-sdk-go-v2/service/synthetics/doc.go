// Synthetics.
//
// # Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics
//
// You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to continually monitor your services.
// You can create and manage canaries, which are modular, lightweight scripts that
// monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. You can set up your
// canaries to run 24 hours a day, once per minute. The canaries help you check the
// availability and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by
// investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. The
// canaries seamlessly integrate with CloudWatch ServiceLens to help you trace the
// causes of impacted nodes in your applications. For more information, see [Using ServiceLens to Monitor the Health of Your Applications]in the
// Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
//
// Before you create and manage canaries, be aware of the security considerations.
// For more information, see [Security Considerations for Synthetics Canaries].
