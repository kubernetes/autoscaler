// # Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack
//
// You can use the Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack API to manage your
// support cases in Slack for your Amazon Web Services account. After you configure
// your Slack workspace and channel with the Amazon Web Services Support App, you
// can perform the following tasks directly in your Slack channel:
//
//   - Create, search, update, and resolve your support cases
//
//   - Request service quota increases for your account
//
//   - Invite Amazon Web Services Support agents to your channel so that you can
//     chat directly about your support cases
//
// For more information about how to perform these actions in Slack, see the
// following documentation in the Amazon Web Services Support User Guide:
//
// [Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack]
//
// [Joining a live chat session with Amazon Web Services Support]
//
// [Requesting service quota increases]
//
// [Amazon Web Services Support App commands in Slack]
//
// You can also use the Amazon Web Services Management Console instead of the
// Amazon Web Services Support App API to manage your Slack configurations. For
// more information, see [Authorize a Slack workspace to enable the Amazon Web Services Support App].
//
//   - You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the Amazon Web
//     Services Support App API.
//
//   - For more information about the Amazon Web Services Support App endpoints,
//     see the [Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack endpoints]in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
