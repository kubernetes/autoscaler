// Package networkflowmonitor provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for Network Flow Monitor.
//
// Network Flow Monitor is a feature of Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitoring that
// provides visibility into the performance of network flows for your Amazon Web
// Services workloads, between instances in subnets, as well as to and from Amazon
// Web Services. Lightweight agents that you install on the instances capture
// performance metrics for your network flows, such as packet loss and latency, and
// send them to the Network Flow Monitor backend. Then, you can view and analyze
// metrics from the top contributors for each metric type, to help troubleshoot
// issues.
//
// In addition, when you create a monitor, Network Flow Monitor provides a network
// health indicator (NHI) that informs you whether there were Amazon Web Services
// network issues for one or more of the network flows tracked by a monitor, during
// a time period that you choose. By using this value, you can independently
// determine if the Amazon Web Services network is impacting your workload during a
// specific time frame, to help you focus troubleshooting efforts.
//
// To learn more about Network Flow Monitor, see the [Network Flow Monitor User Guide] in the Amazon CloudWatch
// User Guide.
