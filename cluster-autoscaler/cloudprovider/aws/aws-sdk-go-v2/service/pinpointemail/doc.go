// # Amazon Pinpoint Email Service
//
// Welcome to the Amazon Pinpoint Email API Reference. This guide provides
// information about the Amazon Pinpoint Email API (version 1.0), including
// supported operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.
//
// [Amazon Pinpoint]is an AWS service that you can use to engage with your customers across
// multiple messaging channels. You can use Amazon Pinpoint to send email, SMS text
// messages, voice messages, and push notifications. The Amazon Pinpoint Email API
// provides programmatic access to options that are unique to the email channel and
// supplement the options provided by the Amazon Pinpoint API.
//
// If you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, you might find it helpful to also review the [Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide]
// . The Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide provides tutorials, code samples, and
// procedures that demonstrate how to use Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically
// and how to integrate Amazon Pinpoint functionality into mobile apps and other
// types of applications. The guide also provides information about key topics such
// as Amazon Pinpoint integration with other AWS services and the limits that apply
// to using the service.
//
// The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in several AWS Regions and it
// provides an endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of all the Regions
// and endpoints where the API is currently available, see [AWS Service Endpoints]in the Amazon Web
// Services General Reference. To learn more about AWS Regions, see [Managing AWS Regions]in the Amazon
// Web Services General Reference.
//
// In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability
// Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private,
// low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These
// Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and
// redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of
// Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see [AWS Global Infrastructure].
