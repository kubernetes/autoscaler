// Package organizations provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS Organizations.

// Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple
// Amazon Web Services accounts into an organization and centrally manage your
// accounts and their resources.
//
// This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations operations. For more
// information about using this service, see the [Organizations User Guide].
//
// # Support and feedback for Organizations

// forums, see [Forums Help].
//
// # Endpoint to call When using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDK
//
// For the current release of Organizations, specify the us-east-1 region for all
// Amazon Web Services API and CLI calls made from the commercial Amazon Web
// Services Regions outside of China. If calling from one of the Amazon Web
// Services Regions in China, then specify cn-northwest-1 . You can do this in the
// CLI by using these parameters and commands:
//
//   - Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint
//     and its region:
//
// --endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (from commercial
//
//	Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)
//
// or
//
// --endpoint-url https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn (from
//
//	Amazon Web Services Regions in China)
//
//	- Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this
//	command:
//
// aws configure set default.region us-east-1 (from commercial Amazon Web Services
//
//	Regions outside of China)
//
// or
//
// aws configure set default.region cn-northwest-1 (from Amazon Web Services
//
//	Regions in China)
//
//	- Use the following parameter with each command to specify the endpoint:
//
// --region us-east-1 (from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of
//
//	China)
//
// or
//
// --region cn-northwest-1 (from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)
//
// # Recording API Requests
//
// Organizations supports CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services
// API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an
// Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can
// determine which requests the Organizations service received, who made the
// request and when, and so on. For more about Organizations and its support for
// CloudTrail, see [Logging Organizations API calls with CloudTrail]in the Organizations User Guide. To learn more about
// CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the [CloudTrail User Guide].
