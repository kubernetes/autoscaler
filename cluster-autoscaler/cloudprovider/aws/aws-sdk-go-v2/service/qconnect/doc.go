// Amazon Q in Connect is a generative AI customer service assistant. It is an
// LLM-enhanced evolution of Amazon Connect Wisdom that delivers real-time
// recommendations to help contact center agents resolve customer issues quickly
// and accurately.
//
// Amazon Q in Connect automatically detects customer intent during calls and
// chats using conversational analytics and natural language understanding (NLU).
// It then provides agents with immediate, real-time generative responses and
// suggested actions, and links to relevant documents and articles. Agents can also
// query Amazon Q in Connect directly using natural language or keywords to answer
// customer requests.
//
// Use the Amazon Q in Connect APIs to create an assistant and a knowledge base,
// for example, or manage content by uploading custom files.
