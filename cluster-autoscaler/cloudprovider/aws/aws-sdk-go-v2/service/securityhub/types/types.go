	//   example, for the ResourceTags field, the filter Department NOT_EQUALS Finance
	//   matches findings that don’t have the value Finance for the Department tag.
	//
	// NOT_CONTAINS and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND . A
	// finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the
	// filters Department NOT_CONTAINS Security AND Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance
	// match a finding that excludes both the Security and Finance values.

// A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.
type StringFilter struct {

	// The condition to apply to a string value when filtering Security Hub findings.
	//
	// To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following
	// comparison operators:
	//
	//   - To search for values that include the filter value, use CONTAINS . For
	//   example, the filter Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that have a
	//   Title that includes the string CloudFront.
	//
	//   - To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use EQUALS . For
	//   example, the filter AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings
	//   that have an account ID of 123456789012 .
	//
	//   - To search for values that start with the filter value, use PREFIX . For
	//   example, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX us matches findings that have a
	//   ResourceRegion that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with a
	//   different value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
	//
	// CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined by OR . A
	// finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters
	// Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
	// includes either CloudFront , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.
	//
	// To search for values that don’t have the filter value, use one of the following
	// comparison operators:
	//
	//   - To search for values that exclude the filter value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For
	//   example, the filter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that have a
	//   Title that excludes the string CloudFront.
	//
	//   - To search for values other than the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For
	//   example, the filter AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings
	//   that have an account ID other than 123456789012 .
	//
	//   - To search for values that don't start with the filter value, use
	//   PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
	//   us matches findings with a ResourceRegion that starts with a value other than
	//   us .
	//
	// NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are
	// joined by AND . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For
	// example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS
	// CloudWatch match a finding that excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
	// title.
	//
	// You can’t have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same
	// field. Similarly, you can't provide both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or
	// PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way
	// returns an error. CONTAINS filters can only be used with other CONTAINS
	// filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.
	//
	// You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for
	// the same field. Security Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and then the
	// NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.
	//
	// For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings
	// that have resource types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It then
	// excludes findings that have a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings that
	// have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .
	//
	//   - ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam
	//
	//   - ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2
	//
	//   - ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
	//
	//   - ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
	//
	// CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only with automation rules V1.
	// CONTAINS_WORD operator is only supported in GetFindingsV2 ,
	// GetFindingStatisticsV2 , GetResourcesV2 , and GetResourceStatisticsV2 APIs. For
	// more information, see [Automation rules]in the Security Hub User Guide.
