// Package arczonalshift provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS ARC - Zonal Shift.
//
// Welcome to the API Reference Guide for zonal shift and zonal autoshift in
// Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller (ARC).
//
// You can start a zonal shift to move traffic for a load balancer resource away
// from an Availability Zone to help your application recover quickly from an
// impairment in an Availability Zone. For example, you can recover your
// application from a developer's bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web
// Services infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone.
//
// You can also configure zonal autoshift for supported load balancer resources.
// Zonal autoshift is a capability in ARC where you authorize Amazon Web Services
// to shift away application resource traffic from an Availability Zone during
// events, on your behalf, to help reduce your time to recovery. Amazon Web
// Services starts an autoshift when internal telemetry indicates that there is an
// Availability Zone impairment that could potentially impact customers.
//
// To help make sure that zonal autoshift is safe for your application, you must
// also configure practice runs when you enable zonal autoshift for a resource.
// Practice runs start weekly zonal shifts for a resource, to shift traffic for the
// resource away from an Availability Zone. Practice runs help you to make sure, on
// a regular basis, that you have enough capacity in all the Availability Zones in
// an Amazon Web Services Region for your application to continue to operate
// normally when traffic for a resource is shifted away from one Availability Zone.
//
// Before you configure practice runs or enable zonal autoshift, we strongly
// recommend that you prescale your application resource capacity in all
// Availability Zones in the Region where your application resources are deployed.
// You should not rely on scaling on demand when an autoshift or practice run
// starts. Zonal autoshift, including practice runs, works independently, and does
// not wait for auto scaling actions to complete. Relying on auto scaling, instead
// of pre-scaling, can result in loss of availability.
//
// If you use auto scaling to handle regular cycles of traffic, we strongly
// recommend that you configure the minimum capacity of your auto scaling to
// continue operating normally with the loss of an Availability Zone.
//
// Be aware that ARC does not inspect the health of individual resources. Amazon
// Web Services only starts an autoshift when Amazon Web Services telemetry detects
// that there is an Availability Zone impairment that could potentially impact
// customers. In some cases, resources might be shifted away that are not
// experiencing impact.
//
// For more information about using zonal shift and zonal autoshift, see the [Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide].
