// Package keyspaces provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon Keyspaces.
//
// Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly available, and
// managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service. Amazon Keyspaces makes it
// easy to migrate, run, and scale Cassandra workloads in the Amazon Web Services
// Cloud. With just a few clicks on the Amazon Web Services Management Console or a
// few lines of code, you can create keyspaces and tables in Amazon Keyspaces,
// without deploying any infrastructure or installing software.
//
// In addition to supporting Cassandra Query Language (CQL) requests via
// open-source Cassandra drivers, Amazon Keyspaces supports data definition
// language (DDL) operations to manage keyspaces and tables using the Amazon Web
// Services SDK and CLI, as well as infrastructure as code (IaC) services and tools
// such as CloudFormation and Terraform. This API reference describes the supported
// DDL operations in detail.
//
// For the list of all supported CQL APIs, see [Supported Cassandra APIs, operations, and data types in Amazon Keyspaces] in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer
// Guide.
//
// To learn how Amazon Keyspaces API actions are recorded with CloudTrail, see [Amazon Keyspaces information in CloudTrail] in
// the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
//
// For more information about Amazon Web Services APIs, for example how to
// implement retry logic or how to sign Amazon Web Services API requests, see [Amazon Web Services APIs]in
// the General Reference.
