// # Amazon Cognito Sync
//
// Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that enable
// cross-device syncing of application-related user data. High-level client
// libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You can use these libraries to
// persist data locally so that it's available even if the device is offline.
// Developer credentials don't need to be stored on the mobile device to access the
// service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and
// credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of
// key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user identity.
//
// With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessible only
// to credentials assigned to that identity. In order to use the Cognito Sync
// service, you need to make API calls using credentials retrieved with [Amazon Cognito Identity service].
//
// If you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS application, you will
// probably want to make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the [Developer Guide for Android]
// and the [Developer Guide for iOS].
