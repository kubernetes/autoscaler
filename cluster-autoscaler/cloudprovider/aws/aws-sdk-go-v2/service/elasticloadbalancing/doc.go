// Package elasticloadbalancing provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for Elastic Load Balancing.
//
// # Elastic Load Balancing
//
// A load balancer can distribute incoming traffic across your EC2 instances. This
// enables you to increase the availability of your application. The load balancer
// also monitors the health of its registered instances and ensures that it routes
// traffic only to healthy instances. You configure your load balancer to accept
// incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with
// a protocol and port number for connections from clients to the load balancer and
// a protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to the
// instances.
//
// Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Application Load
// Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. You can select a
// load balancer based on your application needs. For more information, see the [Elastic Load Balancing User Guide].
//
// This reference covers the 2012-06-01 API, which supports Classic Load
// Balancers. The 2015-12-01 API supports Application Load Balancers and Network
// Load Balancers.
//
// To get started, create a load balancer with one or more listeners using CreateLoadBalancer.
// Register your instances with the load balancer using RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer.
//
// All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they
// complete at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds with a 200 OK
// response code.
