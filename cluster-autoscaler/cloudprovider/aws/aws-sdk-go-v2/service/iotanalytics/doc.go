// Package iotanalytics provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS IoT Analytics.
//
// IoT Analytics allows you to collect large amounts of device data, process
// messages, and store them. You can then query the data and run sophisticated
// analytics on it. IoT Analytics enables advanced data exploration through
// integration with Jupyter Notebooks and data visualization through integration
// with Amazon QuickSight.
//
// Traditional analytics and business intelligence tools are designed to process
// structured data. IoT data often comes from devices that record noisy processes
// (such as temperature, motion, or sound). As a result the data from these devices
// can have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and false readings that must be
// cleaned up before analysis can occur. Also, IoT data is often only meaningful in
// the context of other data from external sources.
//
// IoT Analytics automates the steps required to analyze data from IoT devices.
// IoT Analytics filters, transforms, and enriches IoT data before storing it in a
// time-series data store for analysis. You can set up the service to collect only
// the data you need from your devices, apply mathematical transforms to process
// the data, and enrich the data with device-specific metadata such as device type
// and location before storing it. Then, you can analyze your data by running
// queries using the built-in SQL query engine, or perform more complex analytics
// and machine learning inference. IoT Analytics includes pre-built models for
// common IoT use cases so you can answer questions like which devices are about to
// fail or which customers are at risk of abandoning their wearable devices.
