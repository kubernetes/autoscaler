// Package route53resolver provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for Amazon Route 53 Resolver.
//
// When you create a VPC using Amazon VPC, you automatically get DNS resolution
// within the VPC from Route 53 Resolver. By default, Resolver answers DNS queries
// for VPC domain names such as domain names for EC2 instances or Elastic Load
// Balancing load balancers. Resolver performs recursive lookups against public
// name servers for all other domain names.
//
// You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and your network over a
// Direct Connect or VPN connection:
//
// # Forward DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Route 53 Resolver
//
// DNS resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in a
// specified VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers to easily resolve domain names for
// Amazon Web Services resources such as EC2 instances or records in a Route 53
// private hosted zone. For more information, see [How DNS Resolvers on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53 Resolver]in the Amazon Route 53 Developer
// Guide.
//
// # Conditionally forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on your network
//
// You can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2
// instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on your network. To forward selected
// queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain names for the DNS
// queries that you want to forward (such as example.com), and the IP addresses of
// the DNS resolvers on your network that you want to forward the queries to. If a
// query matches multiple rules (example.com, acme.example.com), Resolver chooses
// the rule with the most specific match (acme.example.com) and forwards the query
// to the IP addresses that you specified in that rule. For more information, see [How Route 53 Resolver Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to Your Network]
// in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.
//
// Like Amazon VPC, Resolver is Regional. In each Region where you have VPCs, you
// can choose whether to forward queries from your VPCs to your network (outbound
// queries), from your network to your VPCs (inbound queries), or both.
