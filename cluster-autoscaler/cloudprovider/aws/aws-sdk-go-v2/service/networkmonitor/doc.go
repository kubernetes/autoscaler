// Package networkmonitor provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor.
//
// Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor is an Amazon Web Services active network
// monitoring service that identifies if a network issues exists within the Amazon
// Web Services network or your own company network. Within Network Monitor you'll
// choose the source VPCs and subnets from the Amazon Web Services network in which
// you operate and then you'll choose the destination IP addresses from your
// on-premises network. From these sources and destinations, Network Monitor
// creates a monitor containing all the possible source and destination
// combinations, each of which is called a probe, within a single monitor. These
// probes then monitor network traffic to help you identify where network issues
// might be affecting your traffic.
//
// Before you begin, ensure the Amazon Web Services CLI is configured in the
// Amazon Web Services Account where you will create the Network Monitor resource.
// Network Monitor doesnâ€™t support creation on cross-account resources, but you can
// create a Network Monitor in any subnet belonging to a VPC owned by your Account.
//
// For more information, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor] in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
