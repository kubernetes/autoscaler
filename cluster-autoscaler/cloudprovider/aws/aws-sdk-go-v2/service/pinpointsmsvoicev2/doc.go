// # Regional availability
//
// The AWS End User Messaging SMS and Voice version 2 API Reference is available
// in several Amazon Web Services Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of
// these Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is
// currently available, see [Amazon Web Services Service Endpoints]and [Amazon Pinpoint endpoints and quotas] in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. To
// learn more about Amazon Web Services Regions, see [Managing Amazon Web Services Regions]in the Amazon Web Services
// General Reference.
//
// In each Region, Amazon Web Services maintains multiple Availability Zones.
// These Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united
// by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network
// connections. These Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of
// availability and redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To learn more about
// the number of Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see [Amazon Web Services Global Infrastructure.]
