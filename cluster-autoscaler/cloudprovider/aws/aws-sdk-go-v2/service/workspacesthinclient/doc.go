// Package workspacesthinclient provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client.
//
// Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client is an affordable device built to work with Amazon
// Web Services End User Computing (EUC) virtual desktops to provide users with a
// complete cloud desktop solution. WorkSpaces Thin Client is a compact device
// designed to connect up to two monitors and USB devices like a keyboard, mouse,
// headset, and webcam. To maximize endpoint security, WorkSpaces Thin Client
// devices do not allow local data storage or installation of unapproved
// applications. The WorkSpaces Thin Client device ships preloaded with device
// management software.
//
// You can use these APIs to complete WorkSpaces Thin Client tasks, such as
// creating environments or viewing devices. For more information about WorkSpaces
// Thin Client, including the required permissions to use the service, see the [Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client Administrator Guide].
// For more information about using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage your
// WorkSpaces Thin Client resources, see the [WorkSpaces Thin Client section of the CLI Reference].
