// # Amazon WorkSpaces Service
//
// Amazon WorkSpaces enables you to provision virtual, cloud-based Microsoft
// Windows or Amazon Linux desktops for your users, known as WorkSpaces. WorkSpaces
// eliminates the need to procure and deploy hardware or install complex software.
// You can quickly add or remove users as your needs change. Users can access their
// virtual desktops from multiple devices or web browsers.
//
// This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
// parameters, and errors of the WorkSpaces service. For more information about the
// supported Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the
// Amazon WorkSpaces service, see [WorkSpaces endpoints and quotas]in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
//
// You can also manage your WorkSpaces resources using the WorkSpaces console,
// Command Line Interface (CLI), and SDKs. For more information about administering
// WorkSpaces, see the [Amazon WorkSpaces Administration Guide]. For more information about using the Amazon WorkSpaces
// client application or web browser to access provisioned WorkSpaces, see the [Amazon WorkSpaces User Guide].
// For more information about using the CLI to manage your WorkSpaces resources,
// see the [WorkSpaces section of the CLI Reference].
