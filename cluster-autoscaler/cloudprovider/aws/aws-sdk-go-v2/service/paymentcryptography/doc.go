// Package paymentcryptography provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for Payment Cryptography Control Plane.
//
// Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Control Plane APIs manage encryption
// keys for use during payment-related cryptographic operations. You can create,
// import, export, share, manage, and delete keys. You can also manage Identity and
// Access Management (IAM) policies for keys. For more information, see [Identity and access management]in the
// Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.
//
// To use encryption keys for payment-related transaction processing and
// associated cryptographic operations, you use the [Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Data Plane]. You can perform actions like
// encrypt, decrypt, generate, and verify payment-related data.
//
// All Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography API calls must be signed and
// transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). We recommend you always use
// the latest supported TLS version for logging API requests.
//
// Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports CloudTrail for control plane
// operations, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events
// for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket
// you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine
// what requests were made to Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, who made
// the request, when it was made, and so on. If you don't conÔ¨Ågure a trail, you can
// still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console. For more
// information, see the [CloudTrail User Guide].
