// Package sagemakera2iruntime provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for Amazon Augmented AI Runtime.
//
// Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) adds the benefit of human judgment to any
// machine learning application. When an AI application can't evaluate data with a
// high degree of confidence, human reviewers can take over. This human review is
// called a human review workflow. To create and start a human review workflow, you
// need three resources: a worker task template, a flow definition, and a human
// loop.
//
// For information about these resources and prerequisites for using Amazon A2I,
// see [Get Started with Amazon Augmented AI]in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.
//
// This API reference includes information about API actions and data types that
// you can use to interact with Amazon A2I programmatically. Use this guide to:
//
//   - Start a human loop with the StartHumanLoop operation when using Amazon A2I
//     with a custom task type. To learn more about the difference between custom and
//     built-in task types, see [Use Task Types]. To learn how to start a human loop using this API,
//     see [Create and Start a Human Loop for a Custom Task Type]in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.
//
//   - Manage your human loops. You can list all human loops that you have
//     created, describe individual human loops, and stop and delete human loops. To
//     learn more, see [Monitor and Manage Your Human Loop]in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.
//
// Amazon A2I integrates APIs from various AWS services to create and start human
// review workflows for those services. To learn how Amazon A2I uses these APIs,
// see [Use APIs in Amazon A2I]in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.
