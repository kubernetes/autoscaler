// Package wafv2 provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// WAFV2.
//
// # WAF
//
// This is the latest version of the WAF API, released in November, 2019. The
// names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and
// namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2", to
// distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to
// this version, because it has a number of significant improvements.
//
// If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access
// any WAF resources that you created before. WAF Classic support will end on
// September 30, 2025.
//
// For information about WAF, including how to migrate your WAF Classic resources
// to this version, see the [WAF Developer Guide].
//
// WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS
// requests that are forwarded to a protected resource. Protected resource types
// include Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application
// Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner
// service, Amplify application, and Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.
// WAF also lets you control access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web
// Services resource that WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify,
// such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query
// strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the requested
// content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response.
//
// This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API
// actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features and
// guidance for configuring and using WAF, see the [WAF Developer Guide].
//
// You can make calls using the endpoints listed in [WAF endpoints and quotas].
//
//   - For regional resources, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A
//     regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API
//     Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App
//     Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.
//
//   - For Amazon CloudFront and Amplify, you must use the API endpoint listed for
//     US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.
//
// Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API
// that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For
// more information, see [Amazon Web Services SDKs].
