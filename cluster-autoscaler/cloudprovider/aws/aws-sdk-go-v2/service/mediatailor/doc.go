// Package mediatailor provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS MediaTailor.
//
// Use the AWS Elemental MediaTailor SDKs and CLI to configure scalable ad
// insertion and linear channels. With MediaTailor, you can assemble existing
// content into a linear stream and serve targeted ads to viewers while maintaining
// broadcast quality in over-the-top (OTT) video applications. For information
// about using the service, including detailed information about the settings
// covered in this guide, see the [AWS Elemental MediaTailor User Guide].
//
// Through the SDKs and the CLI you manage AWS Elemental MediaTailor
// configurations and channels the same as you do through the console. For example,
// you specify ad insertion behavior and mapping information for the origin server
// and the ad decision server (ADS).
