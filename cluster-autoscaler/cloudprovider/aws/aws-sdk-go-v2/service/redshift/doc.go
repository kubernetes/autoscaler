//
// # Overview
//
// This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains documentation
// for one of the programming or command line interfaces you can use to manage
// Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which means
// that some interfaces may require techniques, such as polling or asynchronous
// callback handlers, to determine when a command has been applied. In this
// reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a change is applied
// immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the next maintenance window.
// For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster management interfaces, go to [Using the Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces].
//
// Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a
// data warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster,
// and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus
// on using your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers.
//
// If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by
// reading the [Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide].
//
// If you are a database developer, the [Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide] explains how to design, build, query, and
// maintain the databases that make up your data warehouse.
