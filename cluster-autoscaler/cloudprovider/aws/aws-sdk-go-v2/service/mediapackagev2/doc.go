// Package mediapackagev2 provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS Elemental MediaPackage v2.
//
// This guide is intended for creating AWS Elemental MediaPackage resources in
// MediaPackage Version 2 (v2) starting from May 2023. To get started with
// MediaPackage v2, create your MediaPackage resources. There isn't an automated
// process to migrate your resources from MediaPackage v1 to MediaPackage v2.
//
// The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like URLs and ARNs,
// all have the versioning information added, like "v2", to distinguish from the
// prior version. If you used MediaPackage prior to this release, you can't use the
// MediaPackage v2 CLI or the MediaPackage v2 API to access any MediaPackage v1
// resources.
//
// If you created resources in MediaPackage v1, use video on demand (VOD)
// workflows, and aren't looking to migrate to MediaPackage v2 yet, see the [MediaPackage v1 Live API Reference].
//
// This is the AWS Elemental MediaPackage v2 Live REST API Reference. It describes
// all the MediaPackage API operations for live content in detail, and provides
// sample requests, responses, and errors for the supported web services protocols.
//
// We assume that you have the IAM permissions that you need to use MediaPackage
// via the REST API. We also assume that you are familiar with the features and
// operations of MediaPackage, as described in the AWS Elemental MediaPackage User
// Guide.
