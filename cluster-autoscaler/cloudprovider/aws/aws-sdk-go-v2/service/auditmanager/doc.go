// Audit Manager is a service that provides automated evidence collection so that
// you can continually audit your Amazon Web Services usage. You can use it to
// assess the effectiveness of your controls, manage risk, and simplify compliance.
//
// Audit Manager provides prebuilt frameworks that structure and automate
// assessments for a given compliance standard. Frameworks include a prebuilt
// collection of controls with descriptions and testing procedures. These controls
// are grouped according to the requirements of the specified compliance standard
// or regulation. You can also customize frameworks and controls to support
// internal audits with specific requirements.
