// # Amazon Neptune
//
// Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph database service that
// makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected
// datasets. The core of Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph
// database engine optimized for storing billions of relationships and querying the
// graph with milliseconds latency. Amazon Neptune supports popular graph models
// Property Graph and W3C's RDF, and their respective query languages Apache
// TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL, allowing you to easily build queries that
// efficiently navigate highly connected datasets. Neptune powers graph use cases
// such as recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, drug
// discovery, and network security.
//
// This interface reference for Amazon Neptune contains documentation for a
// programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon Neptune. Note
// that Amazon Neptune is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might
// require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a
// command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate
// whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during
// the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list
// following some related topics from the user guide.
