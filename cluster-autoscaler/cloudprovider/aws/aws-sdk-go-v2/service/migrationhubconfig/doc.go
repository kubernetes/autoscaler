// Package migrationhubconfig provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWS Migration Hub Config.
//
// The AWS Migration Hub home region APIs are available specifically for working
// with your Migration Hub home region. You can use these APIs to determine a home
// region, as well as to create and work with controls that describe the home
// region.
//
//   - You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate,
//     disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or a
//     HomeRegionNotSetException error is returned.
//
//   - API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted
//     outside of your home region.
//
//   - If you call a write API outside the home region, an InvalidInputException is
//     returned.
//
//   - You can call GetHomeRegion action to obtain the account's Migration Hub home
//     region.
//
// For specific API usage, see the sections that follow in this AWS Migration Hub
// Home Region API reference.
