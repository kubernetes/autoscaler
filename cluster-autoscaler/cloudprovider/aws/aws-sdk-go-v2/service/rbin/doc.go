// Package rbin provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for

//
// This is the Recycle Bin API Reference. This documentation provides descriptions
// and syntax for each of the actions and data types in Recycle Bin.
//
// Recycle Bin is a resource recovery feature that enables you to restore
// accidentally deleted snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs. When using Recycle Bin, if
// your resources are deleted, they are retained in the Recycle Bin for a time
// period that you specify.
//
// You can restore a resource from the Recycle Bin at any time before its
// retention period expires. After you restore a resource from the Recycle Bin, the
// resource is removed from the Recycle Bin, and you can then use it in the same
// way you use any other resource of that type in your account. If the retention
// period expires and the resource is not restored, the resource is permanently
// deleted from the Recycle Bin and is no longer available for recovery. For more
// information about Recycle Bin, see [Recycle Bin]in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User
// Guide.
