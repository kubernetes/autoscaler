// Package health provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Health APIs and Notifications.
//
// # Health
//
// The Health API provides access to the Health information that appears in the [Health Dashboard].
// You can use the API operations to get information about events that might affect
// your Amazon Web Services services and resources.
//
// You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan from [Amazon Web Services Support]
// to use the Health API. If you call the Health API from an Amazon Web Services
// account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support
// plan, you receive a SubscriptionRequiredException error.
//
// For API access, you need an access key ID and a secret access key. Use
// temporary credentials instead of long-term access keys when possible. Temporary
// credentials include an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token
// that indicates when the credentials expire. For more information, see [Best practices for managing Amazon Web Services access keys]in the
// Amazon Web Services General Reference.
//
// You can use the Health endpoint health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS) to call
// the Health API operations. Health supports a multi-Region application
// architecture and has two regional endpoints in an active-passive configuration.
// You can use the high availability endpoint example to determine which Amazon Web
// Services Region is active, so that you can get the latest information from the
// API. For more information, see [Accessing the Health API]in the Health User Guide.
//
// For authentication of requests, Health uses the [Signature Version 4 Signing Process].
//
// If your Amazon Web Services account is part of Organizations, you can use the
// Health organizational view feature. This feature provides a centralized view of
// Health events across all accounts in your organization. You can aggregate Health
// events in real time to identify accounts in your organization that are affected
// by an operational event or get notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the
// organizational view API operations to enable this feature and return event
// information. For more information, see [Aggregating Health events]in the Health User Guide.
//
// When you use the Health API operations to return Health events, see the
// following recommendations:
//
//   - Use the [eventScopeCode]parameter to specify whether to return Health events that are
//     public or account-specific.
//
//   - Use pagination to view all events from the response. For example, if you
//     call the DescribeEventsForOrganization operation to get all events in your
//     organization, you might receive several page results. Specify the nextToken in
//     the next request to return more results.
