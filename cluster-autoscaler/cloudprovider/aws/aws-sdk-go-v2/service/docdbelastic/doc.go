// # Amazon DocumentDB elastic clusters
//
// Amazon DocumentDB elastic-clusters support workloads with millions of
// reads/writes per second and petabytes of storage capacity. Amazon DocumentDB
// elastic clusters also simplify how developers interact with Amazon DocumentDB
// elastic-clusters by eliminating the need to choose, manage or upgrade instances.
//
// Amazon DocumentDB elastic-clusters were created to:
//
//   - provide a solution for customers looking for a database that provides
//     virtually limitless scale with rich query capabilities and MongoDB API
//     compatibility.
//
//   - give customers higher connection limits, and to reduce downtime from
//     patching.
//
//   - continue investing in a cloud-native, elastic, and class leading
//     architecture for JSON workloads.
