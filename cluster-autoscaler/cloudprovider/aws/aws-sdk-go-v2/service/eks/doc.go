// Package eks provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for Amazon
// Elastic Kubernetes Service.
//
// Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes
// it easy for you to run Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services without needing to
// setup or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an
// open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of
// containerized applications.
//
// Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so
// you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community.
// Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications
// running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises
// data centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any
// standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification
// required.
