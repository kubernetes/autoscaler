// Package billingconductor provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWSBillingConductor.
//
// Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor is a fully managed service that you can
// use to customize a [proforma]version of your billing data each month, to accurately show
// or chargeback your end customers. Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor doesn't
// change the way you're billed by Amazon Web Services each month by design.
// Instead, it provides you with a mechanism to configure, generate, and display
// rates to certain customers over a given billing period. You can also analyze the
// difference between the rates you apply to your accounting groupings relative to
// your actual rates from Amazon Web Services. As a result of your Amazon Web
// Services Billing Conductor configuration, the payer account can also see the
// custom rate applied on the billing details page of the [Amazon Web Services Billing console], or configure a cost
// and usage report per billing group.
//
// This documentation shows how you can configure Amazon Web Services Billing
// Conductor using its API. For more information about using the [Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor]user interface,
// see the [Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor User Guide].
