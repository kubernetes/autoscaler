// # Amazon Cognito Federated Identities
//
// Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped
// temporary credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. It
// uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consistent identity
// over the lifetime of an application.
//
// Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with
// one or more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with
// Amazon) or an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support
// unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique identifier for
// each user and acts as an OpenID token provider trusted by Security Token Service
// (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege Amazon Web Services credentials.
//
// For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer
// Guide see [Authentication Flow].
//
// For more information see [Amazon Cognito Federated Identities].
