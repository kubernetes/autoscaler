// # Amazon Elastic File System
//
// Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file storage
// for use with Amazon EC2 Linux and Mac instances in the Amazon Web Services
// Cloud. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking
// automatically as you add and remove files, so that your applications have the
// storage they need, when they need it. For more information, see the [Amazon Elastic File System API Reference]and the [Amazon Elastic File System User Guide].
