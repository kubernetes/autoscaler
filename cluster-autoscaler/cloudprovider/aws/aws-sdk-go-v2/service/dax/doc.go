// Package dax provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for Amazon
// DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX).
//
// DAX is a managed caching service engineered for Amazon DynamoDB. DAX
// dramatically speeds up database reads by caching frequently-accessed data from
// DynamoDB, so applications can access that data with sub-millisecond latency. You
// can create a DAX cluster easily, using the AWS Management Console. With a few
// simple modifications to your code, your application can begin taking advantage
// of the DAX cluster and realize significant improvements in read performance.
