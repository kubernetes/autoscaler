// Systems Manager GUI Connect, a component of Fleet Manager, lets you connect to
// your Window Server-type Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances
// using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). GUI Connect, which is powered by [Amazon DCV],
// provides you with secure connectivity to your Windows Server instances directly
// from the Systems Manager console. You can have up to four simultaneous
// connections in a single browser window. In the console, GUI Connect is also
// referred to as Fleet Manager Remote Desktop.
