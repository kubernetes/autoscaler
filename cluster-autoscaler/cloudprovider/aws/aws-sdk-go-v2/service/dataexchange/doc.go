// Package dataexchange provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS Data Exchange.
//
// AWS Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to exchange
// data in the cloud. You can use the AWS Data Exchange APIs to create, update,
// manage, and access file-based data set in the AWS Cloud.
//
// As a subscriber, you can view and access the data sets that you have an
// entitlement to through a subscription. You can use the APIs to download or copy
// your entitled data sets to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for use
// across a variety of AWS analytics and machine learning services.
//
// As a provider, you can create and manage your data sets that you would like to
// publish to a product. Being able to package and provide your data sets into
// products requires a few steps to determine eligibility. For more information,
// visit the AWS Data Exchange User Guide.
//
// A data set is a collection of data that can be changed or updated over time.
// Data sets can be updated using revisions, which represent a new version or
// incremental change to a data set. A revision contains one or more assets. An
// asset in AWS Data Exchange is a piece of data that can be stored as an Amazon S3
// object, Redshift datashare, API Gateway API, AWS Lake Formation data permission,
// or Amazon S3 data access. The asset can be a structured data file, an image
// file, or some other data file. Jobs are asynchronous import or export operations
// used to create or copy assets.
