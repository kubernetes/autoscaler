// Package rum provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// CloudWatch RUM.
//
// With Amazon CloudWatch RUM, you can perform real-user monitoring to collect
// client-side data about your web application performance from actual user
// sessions in real time. The data collected includes page load times, client-side
// errors, and user behavior. When you view this data, you can see it all
// aggregated together and also see breakdowns by the browsers and devices that
// your customers use.
//
// You can use the collected data to quickly identify and debug client-side
// performance issues. CloudWatch RUM helps you visualize anomalies in your
// application performance and find relevant debugging data such as error messages,
// stack traces, and user sessions. You can also use RUM to understand the range of
// end-user impact including the number of users, geolocations, and browsers used.
