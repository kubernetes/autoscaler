// Package glacier provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon Glacier.
//
//	Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) is a storage solution for "cold data."
//
// Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure, durable,
// and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival. With Glacier, customers
// can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or decades. Glacier
// also enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and
// scaling storage to AWS, so they don't have to worry about capacity planning,
// hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure and recovery, or
// time-consuming hardware migrations.
//
// Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount and your
// data is rarely retrieved. If your application requires fast or frequent access
// to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more information, see [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)].
//
// You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the
// total amount of data you can store in Glacier.
//
// If you are a first-time user of Glacier, we recommend that you begin by reading
// the following sections in the Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide:
//
// [What is Amazon S3 Glacier]
//   - - This section of the Developer Guide describes the underlying data model,
//     the operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use to interact with
//     the service.
//
// [Getting Started with Amazon S3 Glacier]
//   - - The Getting Started section walks you through the process of creating a
//     vault, uploading archives, creating jobs to download archives, retrieving the
//     job output, and deleting archives.
