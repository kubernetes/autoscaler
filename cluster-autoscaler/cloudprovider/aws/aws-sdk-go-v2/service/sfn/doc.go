// Package sfn provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Step Functions.
//
// # Step Functions
//
// Step Functions coordinates the components of distributed applications and
// microservices using visual workflows.
//
// You can use Step Functions to build applications from individual components,
// each of which performs a discrete function, or task, allowing you to scale and
// change applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps
// visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. Step
// Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries steps when
// there are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the right
// order every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you can quickly
// diagnose and debug any issues.
//
// Step Functions manages operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure your
// application is available at any scale. You can run tasks on Amazon Web Services,
// your own servers, or any system that has access to Amazon Web Services. You can
// access and use Step Functions using the console, the Amazon Web Services SDKs,
// or an HTTP API. For more information about Step Functions, see the [Step Functions Developer Guide].
//
// If you use the Step Functions API actions using Amazon Web Services SDK
// integrations, make sure the API actions are in camel case and parameter names
// are in Pascal case. For example, you could use Step Functions API action
// startSyncExecution and specify its parameter as StateMachineArn .
