// Package resourcegroups provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS Resource Groups.
//
// Resource Groups lets you organize Amazon Web Services resources such as Amazon
// Elastic Compute Cloud instances, Amazon Relational Database Service databases,
// and Amazon Simple Storage Service buckets into groups using criteria that you
// define as tags. A resource group is a collection of resources that match the
// resource types specified in a query, and share one or more tags or portions of
// tags. You can create a group of resources based on their roles in your cloud
// infrastructure, lifecycle stages, regions, application layers, or virtually any
// criteria. Resource Groups enable you to automate management tasks, such as those
// in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Automation documents, on tag-related
// resources in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. Groups of tagged resources
// also let you quickly view a custom console in Amazon Web Services Systems
// Manager that shows Config compliance and other monitoring data about member
// resources.
//
// To create a resource group, build a resource query, and specify tags that
// identify the criteria that members of the group have in common. Tags are
// key-value pairs.
//
// For more information about Resource Groups, see the [Resource Groups User Guide].
//
// Resource Groups uses a REST-compliant API that you can use to perform the
// following types of operations.
//
//   - Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on resource groups and
//     resource query entities
//
//   - Applying, editing, and removing tags from resource groups
//
//   - Resolving resource group member Amazon resource names (ARN)s so they can be
//     returned as search results
//
//   - Getting data about resources that are members of a group
//
//   - Searching Amazon Web Services resources based on a resource query
