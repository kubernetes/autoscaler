// Package managedblockchain provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for Amazon Managed Blockchain.
//
// Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service for creating and managing
// blockchain networks using open-source frameworks. Blockchain allows you to build
// applications where multiple parties can securely and transparently run
// transactions and share data without the need for a trusted, central authority.
//
// Managed Blockchain supports the Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum open-source
// frameworks. Because of fundamental differences between the frameworks, some API
// actions or data types may only apply in the context of one framework and not the
// other. For example, actions related to Hyperledger Fabric network members such
// as CreateMember and DeleteMember don't apply to Ethereum.
//
// The description for each action indicates the framework or frameworks to which
// it applies. Data types and properties that apply only in the context of a
// particular framework are similarly indicated.
