// Package pcs provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Parallel Computing Service.
//
// Amazon Web Services Parallel Computing Service (Amazon Web Services PCS) is a
// managed service that makes it easier for you to run and scale your high
// performance computing (HPC) workloads, and build scientific and engineering
// models on Amazon Web Services using Slurm. For more information, see the [Amazon Web Services Parallel Computing Service User Guide].
//
// This reference describes the actions and data types of the service management
// API. You can use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to call the API actions in
// software, or use the Command Line Interface (CLI) to call the API actions
// manually. These API actions manage the service through an Amazon Web Services
// account.
//
// The API actions operate on Amazon Web Services PCS resources. A resource is an
// entity in Amazon Web Services that you can work with. Amazon Web Services
// services create resources when you use the features of the service. Examples of
// Amazon Web Services PCS resources include clusters, compute node groups, and
// queues. For more information about resources in Amazon Web Services, see [Resource]in the
// Resource Explorer User Guide.
//
// An Amazon Web Services PCS compute node is an Amazon EC2 instance. You don't
// launch compute nodes directly. Amazon Web Services PCS uses configuration
// information that you provide to launch compute nodes in your Amazon Web Services
// account. You receive billing charges for your running compute nodes. Amazon Web
// Services PCS automatically terminates your compute nodes when you delete the
// Amazon Web Services PCS resources related to those compute nodes.
