// Package mpa provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Multi-party Approval.
//
// Multi-party approval is a capability of [Organizations] that allows you to protect a
// predefined list of operations through a distributed approval process. Use
// Multi-party approval to establish approval workflows and transform security
// processes into team-based decisions.
//
// When to use Multi-party approval:
//
//   - You need to align with the Zero Trust principle of "never trust, always
//     verify"
//
//   - You need to make sure that the right humans have access to the right things
//     in the right way
//
//   - You need distributed decision-making for sensitive or critical operations
//
//   - You need to protect against unintended operations on sensitive or critical
//     resources
//
//   - You need formal reviews and approvals for auditing or compliance reasons
//
// For more information, see [What is Multi-party approval] in the Multi-party approval User Guide.
