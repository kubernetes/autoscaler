// Package servicediscovery provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWS Cloud Map.
//
// # Cloud Map
//
// With Cloud Map, you can configure public DNS, private DNS, or HTTP namespaces
// that your microservice applications run in. When an instance becomes available,
// you can call the Cloud Map API to register the instance with Cloud Map. For
// public or private DNS namespaces, Cloud Map automatically creates DNS records
// and an optional health check. Clients that submit public or private DNS queries,
// or HTTP requests, for the service receive an answer that contains up to eight
// healthy records.
