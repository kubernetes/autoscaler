// Package networkfirewall provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWS Network Firewall.
//
// This is the API Reference for Network Firewall. This guide is for developers
// who need detailed information about the Network Firewall API actions, data
// types, and errors.
//
// The REST API requires you to handle connection details, such as calculating
// signatures, handling request retries, and error handling. For general
// information about using the Amazon Web Services REST APIs, see [Amazon Web Services APIs].
//
// To view the complete list of Amazon Web Services Regions where Network Firewall
// is available, see [Service endpoints and quotas]in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
//
// To access Network Firewall using the IPv4 REST API endpoint:
// https://network-firewall..amazonaws.com
//
// To access Network Firewall using the Dualstack (IPv4 and IPv6) REST API
// endpoint: https://network-firewall..aws.api
//
// Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API
// that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For
// more information, see [Amazon Web Services SDKs].
//
// For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and step-by-step
// instructions on how to use them through the Network Firewall console, see the [Network Firewall Developer Guide].
//
// Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion
// detection and prevention service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).
// With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This
// includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT
// gateway, or over VPN or Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules that are
// compatible with Suricata, a free, open source network analysis and threat
// detection engine. Network Firewall supports Suricata version 7.0.3. For
// information about Suricata, see the [Suricata website]and the [Suricata User Guide].
//
// You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a
// number of ways. The following are just a few examples:
//
//   - Allow domains or IP addresses for known Amazon Web Services service
//     endpoints, such as Amazon S3, and block all other forms of traffic.
//
//   - Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain names
//     that your applications can access.
//
//   - Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.
//
//   - Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, regardless
//     of the port used.
//
// To enable Network Firewall for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC
// and in Network Firewall. For information about using Amazon VPC, see [Amazon VPC User Guide].
//
// To start using Network Firewall, do the following:
//
//   - (Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to protect, create
//     it in Amazon VPC.
//
//   - In Amazon VPC, in each Availability Zone where you want to have a firewall
//     endpoint, create a subnet for the sole use of Network Firewall.
//
//   - In Network Firewall, define the firewall behavior as follows:
//
//   - Create stateless and stateful rule groups, to define the components of the
//     network traffic filtering behavior that you want your firewall to have.
//
//   - Create a firewall policy that uses your rule groups and specifies
//     additional default traffic filtering behavior.
//
//   - In Network Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall policy
//     and VPC subnets. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet
//     that you specify, with the behavior that's defined in the firewall policy.
//
//   - In Amazon VPC, use ingress routing enhancements to route traffic through
//     the new firewall endpoints.
//
// After your firewall is established, you can add firewall endpoints for new
// Availability Zones by following the prior steps for the Amazon VPC setup and
// firewall subnet definitions. You can also add endpoints to Availability Zones
// that you're using in the firewall, either for the same VPC or for another VPC,
// by following the prior steps for the Amazon VPC setup, and defining the new VPC
// subnets as VPC endpoint associations.
