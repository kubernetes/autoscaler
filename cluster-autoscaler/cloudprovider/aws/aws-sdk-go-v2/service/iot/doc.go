// IoT.
//
// # IoT
//
// IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected
// devices (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and
// the Amazon Web Services cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data endpoint to
// communicate with, configure rules for data processing and integration with other
// services, organize resources associated with each device (Registry), configure
// logging, and create and manage policies and credentials to authenticate devices.
//
// The service endpoints that expose this API are listed in [Amazon Web Services IoT Core Endpoints and Quotas]. You must use the
// endpoint for the region that has the resources you want to access.
//
// The service name used by [Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4] to sign the request is: execute-api.
//
// For more information about how IoT works, see the [Developer Guide].
//
// For information about how to use the credentials provider for IoT, see [Authorizing Direct Calls to Amazon Web Services Services].
