// Package appfabric provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// AppFabric.
//
// Amazon Web Services AppFabric quickly connects software as a service (SaaS)
// applications across your organization. This allows IT and security teams to
// easily manage and secure applications using a standard schema, and employees can
// complete everyday tasks faster using generative artificial intelligence (AI).
// You can use these APIs to complete AppFabric tasks, such as setting up audit log
// ingestions or viewing user access. For more information about AppFabric,
// including the required permissions to use the service, see the [Amazon Web Services AppFabric Administration Guide]. For more
// information about using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage your
// AppFabric resources, see the [AppFabric section of the CLI Reference].
