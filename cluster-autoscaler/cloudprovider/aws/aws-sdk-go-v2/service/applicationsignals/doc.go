// Package applicationsignals provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for Amazon CloudWatch Application Signals.
//
// Use CloudWatch Application Signals for comprehensive observability of your
// cloud-based applications. It enables real-time service health dashboards and
// helps you track long-term performance trends against your business goals. The
// application-centric view provides you with unified visibility across your
// applications, services, and dependencies, so you can proactively monitor and
// efficiently triage any issues that may arise, ensuring optimal customer
// experience.
//
// Application Signals provides the following benefits:
//
//   - Automatically collect metrics and traces from your applications, and
//     display key metrics such as call volume, availability, latency, faults, and
//     errors.
//
//   - Create and monitor service level objectives (SLOs).
//
//   - See a map of your application topology that Application Signals
//     automatically discovers, that gives you a visual representation of your
//     applications, dependencies, and their connectivity.
//
// Application Signals works with CloudWatch RUM, CloudWatch Synthetics canaries,
// and Amazon Web Services Service Catalog AppRegistry, to display your client
// pages, Synthetics canaries, and application names within dashboards and maps.
