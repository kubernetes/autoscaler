	//   Amazon GameLift has successfully verified the build files and is now launching a
	//   fleet instance.
	//
	//   - FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING -- Fleet status changed from BUILDING to ACTIVATING .
	//   Amazon GameLift is launching a game server process on the fleet instance and is
	//   testing its connectivity with the Amazon GameLift service.

	//
	//   - FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED -- The build failed to download to the fleet
	//   instance.
	//
	//   - FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD -- The game server build was successfully
	//   downloaded to an instance, and Amazon GameLiftis now extracting the build files
	//   from the uploaded build. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to
	//   ACTIVE status. Logs for this stage display a list of the files that are
	//   extracted and saved on the instance. Access the logs by using the URL in
	//   PreSignedLogUrl.
	//
	//   - FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER -- The game server build files were
	//   successfully extracted, and Amazon GameLift is now running the build's install
	//   script (if one is included). Failure in this stage prevents a fleet from moving
	//   to ACTIVE status. Logs for this stage list the installation steps and whether or

	//   install the build files. This event indicates that the failure occurred before
	//   Amazon GameLift could start validation.
	//
	//   - FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG -- The build process was
	//   successful, and the GameLift is now verifying that the game server launch paths,
	//   which are specified in the fleet's runtime configuration, exist. If any listed
	//   launch path exists, Amazon GameLift tries to launch a game server process and

	//   from moving to ACTIVE status. Logs for this stage list the launch paths in the
	//   runtime configuration and indicate whether each is found. Access the logs by
	//   using the URL in PreSignedLogUrl.
	//
	//   - FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the runtime
	//   configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path does not
	//   exist on the instance.
	//
	//   - FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE -- Validation of the runtime
	//   configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path failed to
	//   run on the fleet instance.
	//
	//   - FLEET_VALIDATION_TIMED_OUT -- Validation of the fleet at the end of
	//   creation timed out. Try fleet creation again.
	//
	//   - FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED -- The fleet failed to successfully complete one of
	//   the steps in the fleet activation process. This event code indicates that the
	//   game build was successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and
	//   validated, but was not able to start a server process. For more information, see
	//   [Debug Fleet Creation Issues].
	//
	//   - FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED_NO_INSTANCES -- Fleet creation was not able to
	//   obtain any instances based on the input fleet attributes. Try again at a
	//   different time or choose a different combination of fleet attributes such as
	//   fleet type, instance type, etc.

	//   creation. Describe the fleet event message for more details.
	//
	// VPC peering events:
	//
	//   - FLEET_VPC_PEERING_SUCCEEDED -- A VPC peering connection has been

	//   Amazon Web Services account.
	//
	//   - FLEET_VPC_PEERING_FAILED -- A requested VPC peering connection has failed.
	//   Event details and status information provide additional detail. A common reason
	//   for peering failure is that the two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks of IPv4
	//   addresses. To resolve this, change the CIDR block for the VPC in your Amazon Web
	//   Services account. For more information on VPC peering failures, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html]

	//
	//   - INSTANCE_RECYCLED -- A spot instance was determined to have a high risk of
	//   interruption and is scheduled to be recycled once it has no active game
	//   sessions.
	//
	// Server process events:
	//
	//   - SERVER_PROCESS_INVALID_PATH -- The game server executable or script could
	//   not be found based on the Fleet runtime configuration. Check that the launch
	//   path is correct based on the operating system of the Fleet.
	//
	//   - SERVER_PROCESS_SDK_INITIALIZATION_TIMEOUT -- The server process did not
	//   call InitSDK() within the time expected (5 minutes). Check your game session
	//   log to see why InitSDK() was not called in time. This event is not emitted for
	//   managed container fleets and Anywhere fleets unless they're deployed with the
	//   Amazon GameLift Agent.
	//
	//   - SERVER_PROCESS_PROCESS_READY_TIMEOUT -- The server process did not call
	//   ProcessReady() within the time expected (5 minutes) after calling InitSDK() .
	//   Check your game session log to see why ProcessReady() was not called in time.
	//
	//   - SERVER_PROCESS_CRASHED -- The server process exited without calling
	//   ProcessEnding() . Check your game session log to see why ProcessEnding() was
	//   not called.
	//
	//   - SERVER_PROCESS_TERMINATED_UNHEALTHY -- The server process did not report a
	//   valid health check for too long and was therefore terminated by GameLift. Check
	//   your game session log to see if the thread became stuck processing a synchronous
	//   task for too long.
	//
	//   - SERVER_PROCESS_FORCE_TERMINATED -- The server process did not exit cleanly
	//   within the time expected after OnProcessTerminate() was sent. Check your game
	//   session log to see why termination took longer than expected.
	//
	//   - SERVER_PROCESS_PROCESS_EXIT_TIMEOUT -- The server process did not exit
	//   cleanly within the time expected (30 seconds) after calling ProcessEnding() .
	//   Check your game session log to see why termination took longer than expected.
	//
	// Game session events:

	//
	// Other fleet events:
	//
	//   - FLEET_SCALING_EVENT -- A change was made to the fleet's capacity settings
	//   (desired instances, minimum/maximum scaling limits). Event messaging includes
	//   the new capacity settings.
	//
	//   - FLEET_NEW_GAME_SESSION_PROTECTION_POLICY_UPDATED -- A change was made to

	//
	//   - FLEET_DELETED -- A request to delete a fleet was initiated.

//     making them wait indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you
