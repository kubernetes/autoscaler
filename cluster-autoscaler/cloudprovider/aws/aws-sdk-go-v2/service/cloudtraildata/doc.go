// Package cloudtraildata provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS CloudTrail Data Service.
//
// The CloudTrail Data Service lets you ingest events into CloudTrail from any
// source in your hybrid environments, such as in-house or SaaS applications hosted
// on-premises or in the cloud, virtual machines, or containers. You can store,
// access, analyze, troubleshoot and take action on this data without maintaining
// multiple log aggregators and reporting tools. After you run PutAuditEvents to
// ingest your application activity into CloudTrail, you can use CloudTrail Lake to
// search, query, and analyze the data that is logged from your applications.
