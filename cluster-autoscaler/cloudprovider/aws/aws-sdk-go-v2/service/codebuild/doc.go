// # CodeBuild
//
// CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles
// your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to
// deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own
// build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most popular
// programming languages and build tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more.
// You can also fully customize build environments in CodeBuild to use your own
// build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests. You pay
// only for the build time you consume. For more information about CodeBuild, see
// the [CodeBuild User Guide].
