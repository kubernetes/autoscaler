// Package appmesh provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// AWS App Mesh.
//
// App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it easy to
// monitor and control microservices. App Mesh standardizes how your microservices
// communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high
// availability for your applications.
//
// App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every
// microservice in an application. You can use App Mesh with Amazon Web Services
// Fargate, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services, and Amazon
// EC2.
//
// App Mesh supports microservice applications that use service discovery naming
// for their components. For more information about service discovery on Amazon
// ECS, see [Service Discovery]in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. Kubernetes
// kube-dns and coredns are supported. For more information, see [DNS for Services and Pods] in the
// Kubernetes documentation.
