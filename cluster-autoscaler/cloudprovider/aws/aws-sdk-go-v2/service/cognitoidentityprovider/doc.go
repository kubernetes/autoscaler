// Package cognitoidentityprovider provides the API client, operations, and
// parameter types for Amazon Cognito Identity Provider.
//
// With the Amazon Cognito user pools API, you can configure user pools and
// authenticate users. To authenticate users from third-party identity providers
// (IdPs) in this API, you can [link IdP users to native user profiles]. Learn more about the authentication and
// authorization of federated users at [Adding user pool sign-in through a third party]and in the [User pool federation endpoints and managed login reference].
//
// This API reference provides detailed information about API operations and
// object types in Amazon Cognito.
//
// Along with resource management operations, the Amazon Cognito user pools API
// includes classes of operations and authorization models for client-side and
// server-side authentication of users. You can interact with operations in the
// Amazon Cognito user pools API as any of the following subjects.
//
//   - An administrator who wants to configure user pools, app clients, users,
//     groups, or other user pool functions.
//
//   - A server-side app, like a web application, that wants to use its Amazon Web
//     Services privileges to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.
//
//   - A client-side app, like a mobile app, that wants to make unauthenticated
//     requests to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.
//
// For more information, see [Understanding API, OIDC, and managed login pages authentication] in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide.
//
// With your Amazon Web Services SDK, you can build the logic to support
// operational flows in every use case for this API. You can also make direct REST
// API requests to [Amazon Cognito user pools service endpoints]. The following links can get you started with the
// CognitoIdentityProvider client in supported Amazon Web Services SDKs.
//
// To get started with an Amazon Web Services SDK, see [Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services]. For example actions and
// scenarios, see [Code examples for Amazon Cognito Identity Provider using Amazon Web Services SDKs].
