// Package iotjobsdataplane provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWS IoT Jobs Data Plane.
//
// IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs â€” remote
// operations that are sent to and executed on one or more devices connected to
// Amazon Web Services IoT Core. For example, you can define a job that instructs a
// set of devices to download and install application or firmware updates, reboot,
// rotate certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting operations.
//
// Find the endpoint address for actions in the IoT jobs data plane by running
// this CLI command:
//
//	aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Jobs
//
// The service name used by [Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4] to sign requests is: iot-jobs-data.
//
// To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the remote
// operations to be performed, and you specify a list of targets that should
// perform the operations. The targets can be individual things, thing groups or
// both.
//
// IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available. The
// target starts the execution of the job by downloading the job document,
// performing the operations it specifies, and reporting its progress to Amazon Web
// Services IoT Core. The Jobs service provides commands to track the progress of a
// job on a specific target and for all the targets of the job
//
