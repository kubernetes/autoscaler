// Package ssoadmin provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// AWS Single Sign-On Admin.
//
// IAM Identity Center is the Amazon Web Services solution for connecting your
// workforce users to Amazon Web Services managed applications and other Amazon Web
// Services resources. You can connect your existing identity provider and
// synchronize users and groups from your directory, or create and manage your
// users directly in IAM Identity Center. You can then use IAM Identity Center for
// either or both of the following:
//
//   - User access to applications
//
//   - User access to Amazon Web Services accounts
//
// This guide provides information about single sign-on operations that you can
// use for access to applications and Amazon Web Services accounts. For information
// about IAM Identity Center features, see the [IAM Identity Center User Guide].
//
// IAM Identity Center uses the sso and identitystore API namespaces.
//
// Many API operations for IAM Identity Center rely on identifiers for users and
// groups, known as principals. For more information about how to work with
// principals and principal IDs in IAM Identity Center, see the [Identity Store API Reference].
//
// Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for
// various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, and
// more). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM
// Identity Center and other Amazon Web Services services. For more information
// about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them,
// see [Tools for Amazon Web Services].
