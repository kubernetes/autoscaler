// Package codedeploy provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// AWS CodeDeploy.
//
// CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to
// Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances running in your own facility,
// serverless Lambda functions, or applications in an Amazon ECS service.
//
// You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application content, such as an
// updated Lambda function, updated applications in an Amazon ECS service, code,
// web and configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, multimedia files,
// and so on. CodeDeploy can deploy application content stored in Amazon S3
// buckets, GitHub repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to make
// changes to your existing code before you can use CodeDeploy.
//
// CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you
// avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of
// updating your applications, without many of the risks associated with
// error-prone manual deployments.
//
// # CodeDeploy Components
//
// Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following
// CodeDeploy components:
//
//   - Application: A name that uniquely identifies the application you want to
//     deploy. CodeDeploy uses this name, which functions as a container, to ensure the
//     correct combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group
//     are referenced during a deployment.
//
//   - Deployment group: A set of individual instances, CodeDeploy Lambda
//     deployment configuration settings, or an Amazon ECS service and network details.
//     A Lambda deployment group specifies how to route traffic to a new version of a
//     Lambda function. An Amazon ECS deployment group specifies the service created in
//     Amazon ECS to deploy, a load balancer, and a listener to reroute production
//     traffic to an updated containerized application. An Amazon EC2/On-premises
//     deployment group contains individually tagged instances, Amazon EC2 instances in
//     Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or both. All deployment groups can specify
//     optional trigger, alarm, and rollback settings.
//
//   - Deployment configuration: A set of deployment rules and deployment success
//     and failure conditions used by CodeDeploy during a deployment.
//
//   - Deployment: The process and the components used when updating a Lambda
//     function, a containerized application in an Amazon ECS service, or of installing
//     content on one or more instances.
//
//   - Application revisions: For an Lambda deployment, this is an AppSpec file
//     that specifies the Lambda function to be updated and one or more functions to
//     validate deployment lifecycle events. For an Amazon ECS deployment, this is an
//     AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS task definition, container, and port
//     where production traffic is rerouted. For an EC2/On-premises deployment, this is
//     an archive file that contains source content—source code, webpages, executable
//     files, and deployment scripts—along with an AppSpec file. Revisions are stored
//     in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is
//     uniquely identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both.
//     For GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by its commit ID.
//
// This guide also contains information to help you get details about the
// instances in your deployments, to make on-premises instances available for
// CodeDeploy deployments, to get details about a Lambda function deployment, and
// to get details about Amazon ECS service deployments.
