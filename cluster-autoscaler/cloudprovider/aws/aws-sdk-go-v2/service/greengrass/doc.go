// locally on the data they generate, while still using the cloud for management,
// analytics, and durable storage. AWS IoT Greengrass ensures your devices can
// respond quickly to local events and operate with intermittent connectivity. AWS
// IoT Greengrass minimizes the cost of transmitting data to the cloud by allowing
// you to author AWS Lambda functions that execute locally.
