// Package evidently provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon CloudWatch Evidently.
//
// You can use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently to safely validate new features by
// serving them to a specified percentage of your users while you roll out the
// feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature to help you decide
// when to ramp up traffic to your users. This helps you reduce risk and identify
// unintended consequences before you fully launch the feature.
//
// You can also conduct A/B experiments to make feature design decisions based on
// evidence and data. An experiment can test as many as five variations at once.
// Evidently collects experiment data and analyzes it using statistical methods. It
// also provides clear recommendations about which variations perform better. You
// can test both user-facing features and backend features.
