// Package lexruntimeservice provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for Amazon Lex Runtime Service.
//
// Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint provides a
// set of operations (API). Your conversational bot uses the runtime API to
// understand user utterances (user input text or voice). For example, suppose a
// user says "I want pizza", your bot sends this input to Amazon Lex using the
// runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the user request is for the OrderPizza
// intent (one of the intents defined in the bot). Then Amazon Lex engages in user
// conversation on behalf of the bot to elicit required information (slot values,
// such as pizza size and crust type), and then performs fulfillment activity (that
// you configured when you created the bot). You use the build-time API to create
// and manage your Amazon Lex bot. For a list of build-time operations, see the
// build-time API, .
