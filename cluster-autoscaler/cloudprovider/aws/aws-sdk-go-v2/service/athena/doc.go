// Package athena provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon Athena.
//
// Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that lets you use standard SQL to
// analyze data directly in Amazon S3. You can point Athena at your data in Amazon
// S3 and run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds. Athena is serverless, so
// there is no infrastructure to set up or manage. You pay only for the queries you
// run. Athena scales automatically—executing queries in parallel—so results are
// fast, even with large datasets and complex queries. For more information, see [What is Amazon Athena]
// in the Amazon Athena User Guide.
//
// If you connect to Athena using the JDBC driver, use version 1.1.0 of the driver
// or later with the Amazon Athena API. Earlier version drivers do not support the
// API. For more information and to download the driver, see [Accessing Amazon Athena with JDBC].
