// Package transfer provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// AWS Transfer Family.
//
// Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files
// over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS),
// or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and out of
// Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon EFS. Additionally, you can
// use Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) to transfer files into and out of Amazon S3.
// Amazon Web Services helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to
// Transfer Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and
// providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers
// and partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it
// with Amazon Web Services services for processing, analytics, machine learning,
// and archiving. Getting started with Transfer Family is easy since there is no
// infrastructure to buy and set up.
