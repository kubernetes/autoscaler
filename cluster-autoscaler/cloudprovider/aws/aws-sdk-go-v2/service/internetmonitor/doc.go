// Package internetmonitor provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor.
//
// Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor provides visibility into how internet issues
// impact the performance and availability between your applications hosted on
// Amazon Web Services and your end users. It can reduce the time it takes for you
// to diagnose internet issues from days to minutes. Internet Monitor uses the
// connectivity data that Amazon Web Services captures from its global networking
// footprint to calculate a baseline of performance and availability for internet
// traffic. This is the same data that Amazon Web Services uses to monitor internet
// uptime and availability. With those measurements as a baseline, Internet Monitor
// raises awareness for you when there are significant problems for your end users
// in the different geographic locations where your application runs.
//
// Internet Monitor publishes internet measurements to CloudWatch Logs and
// CloudWatch Metrics, to easily support using CloudWatch tools with health
// information for geographies and networks specific to your application. Internet
// Monitor sends health events to Amazon EventBridge so that you can set up
// notifications. If an issue is caused by the Amazon Web Services network, you
// also automatically receive an Amazon Web Services Health Dashboard notification
// with the steps that Amazon Web Services is taking to mitigate the problem.
//
// To use Internet Monitor, you create a monitor and associate your application's
// resources with it - VPCs, NLBs, CloudFront distributions, or WorkSpaces
// directories - so Internet Monitor can determine where your application's
// internet traffic is. Internet Monitor then provides internet measurements from
// Amazon Web Services that are specific to the locations and ASNs (typically,
// internet service providers or ISPs) that communicate with your application.
//
