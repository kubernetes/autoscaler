// Package codeguruprofiler provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for Amazon CodeGuru Profiler.
//
//	This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Profiler API
//
// operations.
//
// Amazon CodeGuru Profiler collects runtime performance data from your live
// applications, and provides recommendations that can help you fine-tune your
// application performance. Using machine learning algorithms, CodeGuru Profiler
// can help you find your most expensive lines of code and suggest ways you can
// improve efficiency and remove CPU bottlenecks.
//
// Amazon CodeGuru Profiler provides different visualizations of profiling data to
// help you identify what code is running on the CPU, see how much time is
// consumed, and suggest ways to reduce CPU utilization.
//
// Amazon CodeGuru Profiler currently supports applications written in all Java
// virtual machine (JVM) languages and Python. While CodeGuru Profiler supports
// both visualizations and recommendations for applications written in Java, it can
// also generate visualizations and a subset of recommendations for applications
// written in other JVM languages and Python.
//
