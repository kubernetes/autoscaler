// Package workmail provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon WorkMail.
//
// WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendaring service with
// support for existing desktop and mobile email clients. You can access your
// email, contacts, and calendars using Microsoft Outlook, your browser, or other
// native iOS and Android email applications. You can integrate WorkMail with your
// existing corporate directory and control both the keys that encrypt your data
// and the location in which your data is stored.
//
// The WorkMail API is designed for the following scenarios:
//
//   - Listing and describing organizations
//
//   - Managing users
//
//   - Managing groups
//
//   - Managing resources
//
// All WorkMail API operations are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed.
// They not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive
// use of AWS Identity and Access Management users and roles to help facilitate
// access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM
// user to access the WorkMail site, the IAM user gains full administrative
// visibility into the entire WorkMail organization (or as set in the IAM policy).
// This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to create, update, and delete
// users, groups, and resources. This allows developers to perform the scenarios
// listed above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective
// basis using the IAM model.
