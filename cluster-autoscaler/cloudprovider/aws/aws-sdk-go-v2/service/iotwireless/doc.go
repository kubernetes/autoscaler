// Package iotwireless provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS IoT Wireless.
//
// AWS IoT Wireless provides bi-directional communication between
// internet-connected wireless devices and the AWS Cloud. To onboard both LoRaWAN
// and Sidewalk devices to AWS IoT, use the IoT Wireless API. These wireless
// devices use the Low Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN) communication protocol to
// communicate with AWS IoT.
//
// Using the API, you can perform create, read, update, and delete operations for
// your wireless devices, gateways, destinations, and profiles. After onboarding
// your devices, you can use the API operations to set log levels and monitor your
// devices with CloudWatch.
//
// You can also use the API operations to create multicast groups and schedule a
// multicast session for sending a downlink message to devices in the group. By
// using Firmware Updates Over-The-Air (FUOTA) API operations, you can create a
// FUOTA task and schedule a session to update the firmware of individual devices
// or an entire group of devices in a multicast group.
//
// To connect to the AWS IoT Wireless Service, use the Service endpoints as
// described in [IoT Wireless Service endpoints]. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols to connect to the
// endpoints and send requests to the AWS IoT Wireless service. For more
// information, see [Using IPv6 with AWS IoT Wireless].
