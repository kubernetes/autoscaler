//
// The Amazon Web Services Support API Reference is intended for programmers who
// need detailed information about the Amazon Web Services Support operations and
// data types. You can use the API to manage your support cases programmatically.
// The Amazon Web Services Support API uses HTTP methods that return results in
// JSON format.
//
//   - You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan to
//     use the Amazon Web Services Support API.
//
//   - If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that
//     doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, the
//     SubscriptionRequiredException error message appears. For information about
//     changing your support plan, see [Amazon Web Services Support].
//
// You can also use the Amazon Web Services Support API to access features for [Trusted Advisor].
// You can return a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results,
// specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks.
//
// You can manage your support cases with the following Amazon Web Services
// Support API operations:
//

//     information about cases, and resolve cases.
//
//   - The DescribeCommunications, AddCommunicationToCase, and AddAttachmentsToSetoperations retrieve and add communications and attachments to
//     Amazon Web Services Support cases.

//     categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when you call the CreateCase
//     operation.
//

// Advisor operations. For more information, see [Trusted Advisor]in the Amazon Web Services
// Support User Guide.
