// Information about the errors that are returned for each failed resource. This
// information can include InternalServiceException and InvalidParameterException
// errors. It can also include any valid error code returned by the Amazon Web
// Services service that hosts the resource that the ARN key represents.
//
// The following are common error codes that you might receive from other Amazon
// Web Services services:
//
//   - InternalServiceException – This can mean that the Resource Groups Tagging
//     API didn't receive a response from another Amazon Web Services service. It can
//     also mean that the resource type in the request is not supported by the Resource
//     Groups Tagging API. In these cases, it's safe to retry the request and then call
//     [GetResources]to verify the changes.
//
//   - AccessDeniedException – This can mean that you need permission to call the
//     tagging operations in the Amazon Web Services service that contains the
//     resource. For example, to use the Resource Groups Tagging API to tag a Amazon
//     CloudWatch alarm resource, you need permission to call both [TagResources]TagResources and [TagResource]
//     TagResource in the CloudWatch API.
//
// For more information on errors that are generated from other Amazon Web
// Services services, see the documentation for that service.
