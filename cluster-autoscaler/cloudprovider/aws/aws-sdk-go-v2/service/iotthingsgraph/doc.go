// # AWS IoT Things Graph
//
// AWS IoT Things Graph provides an integrated set of tools that enable developers
// to connect devices and services that use different standards, such as units of
// measure and communication protocols. AWS IoT Things Graph makes it possible to
// build IoT applications with little to no code by connecting devices and services
// and defining how they interact at an abstract level.
//
// For more information about how AWS IoT Things Graph works, see the [User Guide].
//
// The AWS IoT Things Graph service is discontinued.
