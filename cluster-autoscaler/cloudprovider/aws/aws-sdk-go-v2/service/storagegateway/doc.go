// Package storagegateway provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS Storage Gateway.
//
// # Storage Gateway Service
//
// Amazon FSx File Gateway is no longer available to new customers. Existing
// customers of FSx File Gateway can continue to use the service normally. For
// capabilities similar to FSx File Gateway, visit [this blog post].
//
// Storage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software appliance
// with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration between an
// organization's on-premises IT environment and the Amazon Web Services storage
// infrastructure. The service enables you to securely upload data to the Amazon
// Web Services Cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery.
//
// Use the following links to get started using the Storage Gateway Service API
// Reference:
//
// [Storage Gateway required request headers]
//   - : Describes the required headers that you must send with every POST request
//     to Storage Gateway.
//
// [Signing requests]
//   - : Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request you send;
//     this topic describes how sign such a request.
//
// [Error responses]
//   - : Provides reference information about Storage Gateway errors.
//
// [Operations in Storage Gateway]
//   - : Contains detailed descriptions of all Storage Gateway operations, their
//     request parameters, response elements, possible errors, and examples of requests
//     and responses.
//
// [Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas]
//   - : Provides a list of each Amazon Web Services Region and the endpoints
//     available for use with Storage Gateway.
//
// Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these resource IDs
// with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in lowercase. You must change
// your resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For example, in
// Storage Gateway the ID for a volume might be vol-AA22BB012345DAF670 . When you
// use this ID with the EC2 API, you must change it to vol-aa22bb012345daf670 .
// Otherwise, the EC2 API might not behave as expected.
//
// IDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway
// volumes are changing to a longer format. Starting in December 2016, all new
// volumes and snapshots will be created with a 17-character string. Starting in
// April 2016, you will be able to use these longer IDs so you can test your
// systems with the new format. For more information, see [Longer EC2 and EBS resource IDs].
//
// For example, a volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the longer volume ID
// format looks like the following:
//
// arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG
// .
//
// A snapshot ID with the longer ID format looks like the following:
// snap-78e226633445566ee .
//
