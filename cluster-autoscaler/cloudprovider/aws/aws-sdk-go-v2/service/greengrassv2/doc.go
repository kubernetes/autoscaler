// Package greengrassv2 provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS IoT Greengrass V2.
//
// IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and ML
// inference capabilities to edge devices. This enables devices to collect and
// analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to local
// events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. Local
// devices can also communicate securely with Amazon Web Services IoT Core and
// export IoT data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. IoT Greengrass developers can
// use Lambda functions and components to create and deploy applications to fleets
// of edge devices for local operation.
//
// IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the IoT Greengrass
// Core software, new APIs, and a new console. Use this API reference to learn how
// to use the IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage components, manage
// deployments, and core devices.
//
// For more information, see [What is IoT Greengrass?] in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.
