// Package supplychain provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS Supply Chain.
//
//	AWS Supply Chain is a cloud-based application that works with your enterprise
//
// resource planning (ERP) and supply chain management systems. Using AWS Supply
// Chain, you can connect and extract your inventory, supply, and demand related
// data from existing ERP or supply chain systems into a single data model.
//
// The AWS Supply Chain API supports configuration data import for Supply Planning.
//
// All AWS Supply chain API operations are Amazon-authenticated and
// certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow
// for the exclusive use of AWS Identity and Access Management users and roles to
// help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies.
