// Package datapipeline provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS Data Pipeline.
//
// AWS Data Pipeline configures and manages a data-driven workflow called a
// pipeline. AWS Data Pipeline handles the details of scheduling and ensuring that
// data dependencies are met so that your application can focus on processing the
// data.
//
// AWS Data Pipeline provides a JAR implementation of a task runner called AWS
// Data Pipeline Task Runner. AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner provides logic for
// common data management scenarios, such as performing database queries and
// running data analysis using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can use
// AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner as your task runner, or you can write your own
// task runner to provide custom data management.
//
// AWS Data Pipeline implements two main sets of functionality. Use the first set
// to create a pipeline and define data sources, schedules, dependencies, and the
// transforms to be performed on the data. Use the second set in your task runner
// application to receive the next task ready for processing. The logic for
// performing the task, such as querying the data, running data analysis, or
// converting the data from one format to another, is contained within the task
// runner. The task runner performs the task assigned to it by the web service,
// reporting progress to the web service as it does so. When the task is done, the
// task runner reports the final success or failure of the task to the web service.
