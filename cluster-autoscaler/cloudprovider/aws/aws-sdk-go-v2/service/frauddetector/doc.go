// Package frauddetector provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for Amazon Fraud Detector.
//
// This is the Amazon Fraud Detector API Reference. This guide is for developers
// who need detailed information about Amazon Fraud Detector API actions, data
// types, and errors. For more information about Amazon Fraud Detector features,
// see the [Amazon Fraud Detector User Guide].
//
// We provide the Query API as well as AWS software development kits (SDK) for
// Amazon Fraud Detector in Java and Python programming languages.
//
// The Amazon Fraud Detector Query API provides HTTPS requests that use the HTTP
// verb GET or POST and a Query parameter Action . AWS SDK provides libraries,
// sample code, tutorials, and other resources for software developers who prefer
// to build applications using language-specific APIs instead of submitting a
// request over HTTP or HTTPS. These libraries provide basic functions that
// automatically take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing your
// requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses, so that it is easier
// for you to get started. For more information about the AWS SDKs, go to [Tools to build on AWS]page,
// scroll down to the SDK section, and choose plus (+) sign to expand the section.
