// Package snowball provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon Import/Export Snowball.
//
// The Amazon Web Services Snow Family provides a petabyte-scale data transport
// solution that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of data between your
// on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snow
// Family commands described here provide access to the same functionality that is
// available in the Amazon Web Services Snow Family Management Console, which
// enables you to create and manage jobs for a Snow Family device. To transfer data
// locally with a Snow Family device, you'll need to use the Snowball Edge client
// or the Amazon S3 API Interface for Snowball or OpsHub for Snow Family. For more
// information, see the [User Guide].
