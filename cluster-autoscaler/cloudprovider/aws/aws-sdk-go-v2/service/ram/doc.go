// Package ram provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Resource Access Manager.
//
// This is the Resource Access Manager API Reference. This documentation provides
// descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in RAM. RAM is a
// service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web Services resources to
// other Amazon Web Services accounts. If you use Organizations to manage your
// accounts, then you can share your resources with your entire organization or to
// organizational units (OUs). For supported resource types, you can also share
// resources with individual Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and users.
