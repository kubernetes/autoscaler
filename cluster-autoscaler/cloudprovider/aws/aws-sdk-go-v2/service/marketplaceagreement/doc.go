// Package marketplaceagreement provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWS Marketplace Agreement Service.
//
// AWS Marketplace is a curated digital catalog that customers can use to find,
// buy, deploy, and manage third-party software, data, and services to build
// solutions and run their businesses. The AWS Marketplace Agreement Service
// provides an API interface that helps AWS Marketplace sellers manage their
// product-related agreements, including listing, searching, and filtering
// agreements.
//
// To manage agreements in AWS Marketplace, you must ensure that your AWS Identity
// and Access Management (IAM) policies and roles are set up. The user must have
// the required policies/permissions that allow them to carry out the actions in
// AWS:
//
//   - DescribeAgreement – Grants permission to users to obtain detailed meta data
//     about any of their agreements.
//
//   - GetAgreementTerms – Grants permission to users to obtain details about the
//     terms of an agreement.
//
//   - SearchAgreements – Grants permission to users to search through all their
//     agreements.
