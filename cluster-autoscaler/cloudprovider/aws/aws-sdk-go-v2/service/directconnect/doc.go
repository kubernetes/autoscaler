// Package directconnect provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS Direct Connect.
//
// Direct Connect links your internal network to an Direct Connect location over a
// standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your
// router, the other to an Direct Connect router. With this connection in place,
// you can create virtual interfaces directly to the Amazon Web Services Cloud (for
// example, to Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3) and to Amazon VPC, bypassing Internet
// service providers in your network path. A connection provides access to all
// Amazon Web Services Regions except the China (Beijing) and (China) Ningxia
// Regions. Amazon Web Services resources in the China Regions can only be accessed
// through locations associated with those Regions.
