// # Amazon Simple Workflow Service
//
// The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build
// applications that use Amazon's cloud to coordinate work across distributed
// components. In Amazon SWF, a task represents a logical unit of work that is
// performed by a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow
// involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in
// accordance with the logical flow of the application.
//
// Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them
// without worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress
// and maintaining their state.
//
// This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of the
// Amazon SWF programming model, see the [Amazon SWF Developer Guide].
