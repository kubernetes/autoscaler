	// If you use User-Personalization-v2, a list of reasons for why the item was
	// included in recommendations. Possible reasons include the following:
	//
	//   - Promoted item - Indicates the item was included as part of a promotion that
	//   you applied in your recommendation request.
	//
	//   - Exploration - Indicates the item was included with exploration. With
	//   exploration, recommendations include items with less interactions data or
	//   relevance for the user. For more information about exploration, see [Exploration].
	//
	//   - Popular item - Indicates the item was included as a placeholder popular
	//   item. If you use a filter, depending on how many recommendations the filter
	//   removes, Amazon Personalize might add placeholder items to meet the numResults
	//   for your recommendation request. These items are popular items, based on
	//   interactions data, that satisfy your filter criteria. They don't have a
	//   relevance score for the user.
