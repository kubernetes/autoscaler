// Work Requests API
//
// Many of the API operations that you use to create and configure Compute resources do not take effect
// immediately. In these cases, the operation spawns an asynchronous workflow to fulfill the request.
// Work requests provide visibility into the status of these in-progress, long-running workflows.
// For more information about work requests and the operations that spawn work requests, see
// Viewing the State of a Compute Work Request (https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/viewingworkrequestcompute.htm).
