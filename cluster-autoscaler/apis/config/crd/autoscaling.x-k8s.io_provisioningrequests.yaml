                    CA will try to create the VMs in an atomic manner, clean any partially provisioned VMs
                    and re-try the operation in a exponential back-off manner. Users can configure the timeout
                    duration after which the request will fail by 'ValidUntilSeconds' key in 'Parameters'.
                    CA will set 'Failed=true' or 'Provisioned=true' condition according to the outcome.
