# CapacityBuffer API

#### Author: Justyna Betkier (jbtk)

# Summary

If the user uses autoscaling the cluster size will be adjusted to the number of
currently running pods. This means that often when a new pod is created its
scheduling time will need to include the time of creating a new node and
attaching it to the cluster. Many users care deeply about pod scheduling time
and therefore would prefer to keep spare capacity in the cluster in order to
speed up start time of the newly created pods.

In order to allow users to express the need for spare capacity in the cluster a
new kubernetes object will be introduced called a `CapacityBuffer`, which will
define spare capacity per workload or set of workloads. Configuration would
be translated to pod specs that could be injected in memory by autoscaler to
drive scaling decisions for the cluster.

# Motivation

While some use cases of buffers can be already accomplished using balloon 
pods/deployments 
([overprovisioning node capacity documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/node-overprovisioning/)) 
there are reasons to introduce Buffers as a separate API concept:
*   simplify configuration of additional capacity in the cluster.
    *   Today it is possible to create balloon pods and deployments, but they
        require maintenance (sizing according to the pods user wants to run) and
        with high numbers they can negatively impact the scheduling speed (as
        the scheduler has to preempt the balloon first before scheduling the
        actual pod). Due to the latter many customers run a balloon per machine,
        but this requires adjusting the size to the machine per nodepool and
        with custom compute classes (CCC) in GKE or karpenter pools the machine
        size is not constant anymore.
    *   Introducing a new API allows us to reference other existing objects to
        simplify the configuration
    *   Having a separate object we can add convenience configuration options in
        the future that will help the users reduce the cost of spare capacity
        compared to running the balloons. For example: spare capacity size
        depending on the deployment size or activating buffer depending on the
        time of the day
*   in the future cloud providers will be able to offer other types of buffers
    that are provider specific that would not be possible to express with
    balloon pods at all (“warm”/stand-by capacity already offered with custom
    APIs by AWS and Azure)
*   with a separate object representing spare capacity we can offer better
    monitoring and insights into usage and needs in the cluster.

There was already a similar proposal that was not implemented in the end:
[Pod headroom](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SyqStWUt407Rcwdtv25yG6MpHdNnbfB3KPmc4zQuz1M/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.coxzr2ev5x0k)

The feature has been requested multiple times by the community
([#749](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/karpenter/issues/749),
[#987](https://github.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/issues/987),
[#3240](https://github.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/issues/3240),
[#3384](https://github.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/issues/3384),
[#4409](https://github.com/aws/karpenter-provider-aws/issues/4409))

## Goals

*   User can define spare capacity in the cluster that should be available for
    the user workloads
*   User pods can use the available capacity without any configuration changes
    (strictly additive, can be managed by the user who owns the pod as well as
    cluster administrators)
*   Open possibility for cloud providers to offer different types of buffers if
    needed

## Non-Goals

*   In the initial implementation the buffers will not be guaranteed/reserved
    for any particular pods, any pod that can run on a given capacity will be
    able to use it. Once scheduler offers concept of reserving cluster capacity
    it will be possible to add configuration options with hard guarantees (for
    example when a user wants to keep a buffer only for top priority pods, but
    on the same nodes there are other pods running)

# Proposal

A `CapacityBuffer` CRD (autoscaling.x-k8s.io) is added to represent spare capacity
requested by the user along with a set of libraries that make it easy to
integrate any autoscaler along with reference implementation in the
[Cluster Autoscaler repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler).

In order to support buffers the cluster will need to run:

*   A controller that translates the buffer configuration into a number of pods
    specs that would represent the spare space in the cluster that is needed.
    The reference implementation would be provided within the cluster autoscaler
    repository with the controller running as a subprocess of the cluster 
    autoscaler, but it is expected that other integrations will depend on it as
    a library rather than full implementation
*   An autoscaler should allow for processing additional pods that are
    representing a buffer (for example treating them as virtual pods) so that
    the capacity in the cluster becomes available.

Note that providing spare capacity depends heavily on the autoscaling
capabilities of the cluster - the support for buffers will depend on the
compatibility of the autoscaler used within the cluster.

### How do we determine the pod spec for targets using scale subresource?

The scale subresource offers a selector to find pods created by a given
resource. In the initial implementation we will assume that all pods are
homogeneous with an exception to the admission hook changes, and therefore we
will take the most recent pod matching this selector. This means that the buffer
will not initialize until it exists with at least one pod of a given target at
the same time.

In the future this can be improved:

*   We can predict the pod spec for known workload definitions (like deployment,
    job or replica set)
*   We can implement better support for popular community owned controllers like
    leader worker set where the assumption that all pods are homogeneous is
    incorrect

### Why can’t the user just specify the number of additional nodes in the buffers that point to set of nodes (like GKE CCC or Karpenter NodePool)?

In many feature requests the users wanted to “just specify an additional number
of nodes” to provision as a spare capacity. This feature is not included in this
design because of the complexity of how this configuration may end up working.

**Example 1**: user specified a buffer of 3 nodes. 3 nodes are created and on
one of them the scheduler puts a pod. Should we create a new node now? In case
of balanced scheduling it would be happening a lot making this buffer not work
as expected growing the cluster with poorly utilized nodes.

**Example 2**: user specified a buffer of 3 nodes, but the node class (like CCC
or Karpenter NodePool) defines different possible shapes of nodes as fallbacks.
What should the size of the buffer be? Is it 3 nodes of the highest priority
that are currently available? Or should we somehow calculate 3x the size of the
top priority on the lower priority nodes?

Instead of that there is an option to specify full buffered capacity as a limit that will
be provisioned in chunks as specified by the PodTemplate.

That being said, if there is a use case for such configuration that would have a
clear meaning to the users and limited number of options needed to specify it,
it should be relatively easy to add a new capacity definition.

### Why a CRD in autoscaling.x-k8s.io and not a core k8s api?

Buffers are not a required concept in each of the clusters and what they offer
will depend on the autoscaling capabilities of the cluster. Adding them as a CRD
in autoscaling space will make it clear and will allow for releasing it
independently of the core k8s.

## Out of scope, may be added as follow up porposals

The initial iteration will cover basic use cases and will allow to simplify
balloon pod/deployment management and allow for reduction of scheduler related
overhead of preemption. But once we launch the initial integration there are
potential next steps:

*   Buffer schedule - option to define a buffer that is active only during
    parts of the day (outside of these hours the buffer is ignored as if it
    did not exist). Example use case: I set up a buffer for the test jobs to
    schedule quickly on the cluster. Tests are mostly run during business
    hours of my organization and I do not want to pay for the extra capacity
    at night or over the weekend.
*   Buffer dedicated for workload: mark the buffer as dedicated for pods defined
    by PodSelector. It would count the pods matching the selector as filling in
    the buffer space. Example usecase: I want to keep buffer for scaling, but I
    know the usual maximum needed for my workload (beyond it normal scale up
    would apply)

## User Stories (Optional)

### Story 1

The user has a deployment of pods that are serving user traffic. In order to
better contain the traffic spikes I want to keep a buffer of a size of 10% of
the deployment size so that when the HPA scales my deployment the new pods are
started faster. Additionally, this speeds up the feedback loop of the metrics
allowing the HPA also to faster provide next scaling decisions.

Note: the size of the buffer will be calculated based on existing replicas to 
avoid situation when the buffer grows before all pods are there to be considered
for a scale up.

Example buffer:
```
apiversion: autoscaling.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: CapacityBuffer
metadata:
  name: my-deployment-buffer
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  scalableRef
    apiGroup: apps
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-deployment
  percentage: 10
  replicas: 1
```

### Story 2

The user is a part of an admin team owning the CI/CD pipeline. The cluster is
used for running one off test tasks that should be completed promptly. However,
the cluster is scaling up and down making the tasks wait for adding a new node.
The admin team wants to keep spare space in the cluster so that the tasks
schedule quickly.

Example buffer:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PodTemplate
metadata:
  name: my-custom-template
  namespace: my-namespace
template:
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: cpu-buffer-container
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "8"
        limits:
          cpu: "8"
        nodeSelector:
          cloud.google.com/compute-class: my-custom-class


apiversion: autoscaling.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: CapacityBuffer
metadata:
  name: testing-capacity
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  limits:
    mem: 5120Mi
    cpi: 40
  podTemplateRef:
    name: my-custom-template
```

## Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

*   The NodeAutoscalingBuffer implementation assumes that the pods run as a part 
    of scale subresource are homogeneous.

## Risks and Mitigations

*   The implementation of buffers will introduce additional “virtual” pods to be
    handled by the autoscalers. In case the buffer chunks were very small the
    number of processed pods may grow - we do not expect that buffers would
    introduce more chunks than the number of pods that user may want to run.
    Since these are only virtual they will introduce less overhead in the
    cluster than balloon pods/deployments (no need to preempt etc).

### What is the responsibility split between the CapacityBuffer controller and autoscaler?

The controller would own the logic of translating the buffer configuration into
a pod spec that would define what spare space needs to be provisioned in the
cluster to fulfill the requirements of the buffer. The autoscaler component
would use the pod spec to provision the capacity.

In case of the cluster autoscaler we would deploy the controller as an optional
subprocess:

![Figure](./images/buffers-component-structure.jpg)

This design has two main advantages compared to embedding all the logic in the
library that would be used in autoscaler code:

*   Responsibility split: it splits the responsibility of understanding buffer
    configuration and exposes to the user what exactly will be provisioned in
    the cluster based on the buffer spec that was provided. Also, if for example
    the target deployment changes it will be visible whether the change was
    already picked up.
*   Extendability: this design will allow for the users to either opt in the
    buffers provided in OSS libraries only or to customize the buffers offering
    by providing their own logic of translation (with option to use the existing
    libraries as a base for their own implementation). This way the user could
    define their custom way of configuring buffers and still use the standard
    autoscaling tools.

#### Buffer controller

Base on the full Buffer spec writes the status including conditions (to mark it
as ready for provisioning) and PodBufferCapacity. In the future the number of
chunks will take into account the k8s Resource Quotas. 

#### Autoscaler

Autoscaler will use the buffer status field and buffer type to determine how
many and what spare capacity to deploy. 
Autoscaler can additionally set conditions on the buffer to communicate error
states and unforeseen circumstances.

### What conditions will be specified in the buffer state?

- ReadyForProvisioning - set by buffer controller, true when buffer status has
correctly set the pod specification in the status. If set to false the buffer
controller will surface errors in the message field.
- LimitedByQuotas - set by buffer controller, true when the buffer is smaller
than specified because of the quotas. The message field will contain info which
quotas are blocking the buffer.
- Provisioning - set by autoscaler once it processes the buffer for the first
time. False in case the buffer is unhelpable (otherwise the scale up events will
be available for each scale up decision). 

### How to directly define cluster capacity?

Currently, the only option to define the cluster capacity is to define a PodSpec
and instantly consume it via scheduling of the pod. However, there is ongoing
work within the sig-scheduling group to define scheduling of workloads and
reservations (which also define cluster capacity). This design work is not
mature enough yet (no KEP proposed) so we will stick with pod template
definition for now and possibly expand to new objects definition when they are
available.

### Why do we offer relative size for a replica based buffer and how does it differ from making the deployment 10% bigger?

Today there is no easy way of just making the deployment 10% bigger, but the
users can already set any scaling targets for HPA. However:

*   Changing the number of instances can influence the metrics that are used by
    HPA so changing the HPA targets or introducing an option to specify
    “provision 10% instances more”. Any of these would require user to retune
    their config every time they want to change the buffer.
*   Some of the user workloads that would use the buffers are not deployments,
    but jobs that start and finish. It is impossible to start them in advance to
    keep the space in the cluster.

### Buffers and k8s resource quotas

Today it is possible to set a resource quota per namespace that will prevent the
user who has access to the namespace from creating too many objects of a 
given type or pods that use too many resources. 

Since buffers are not pods they will not be accounted by the quota system and so
any user who is able to create buffers will be able to create a buffer of any
size.

For the initial implementation on buffers the users should use other tools to
limit the size of the cluster (max size on the GKE node pool/CCC or karpenter
pool, max total size). Once we launch we will reassess the need for other
mechanisms for buffers. 

Two options that should be considered are:
- [recommended at the moment, to reevaluate before implementation] integrating
with k8s resource quotas mechanism: make the buffer controller quota aware, 
apply the quota when translating the buffer config to a pod spec and 
periodically check the total resources used by the namespace
- create a separate API surface (like `BufferPolicy`) to manage what buffers can
be created. This may be needed if we would like to offer different quotas
depending on the `Buffer` type.

# Alternatives

## Do nothing

Since there is already well know path of creating balloon pods/deployments we
could decide to do nothing and point users to these “mechanisms”

### Why not?

Managing balloon pods proves to be problematic - you need to keep them in sync
with the workload they need to scale for or in sync with the VM shape (to avoid
creating too many of these).

We gathered feedback from the customers that maintenance of balloon pods and
sizing them is something that should be simplified.

Balloon pods/deployments allow only for active capacity. Some cloud providers
(Aws and azure) offer already warm/stand by pools consisting of stopped VMs.
Having a single API surface can standardize configuration of these and simplify
testing different buffering variants by the users (user wants to optimize their
cost and startup latency - they want to test different buffer options in order
to decide which one offers them correct cost/efficiency tradeoff - they want a
simple way of switching between similar configurations to test what works best
for them).

## Introduce options within existing objects that match directly their use case

Alternatively we could avoid adding a new object and introduce relevant fields
on HPA, Job, CCC etc.

### Why not?

This solution would end up with options added in multiple places.

From the user point of view they would likely better target each use case, but
they would end up with multiple inconsistent configuration options (as each
place would have some options that apply or not apply there, or some things
would be already implemented and some features would be implemented only for
some of the places).

From the implementation point of view this would require modifying multiple
object definitions including core kubernetes objects and their behavior. In this
case also extensibility would be much harder:

*   Either we would need to introduce a mechanism how these objects communicate
    the needed buffer (so we would need a new object anyway - just lower level
    of abstraction)
*   Or the autoscaler would need to be aware of each object that can declare
    buffers. This would mean that we would need to implement logic for every
    possible object that wants to support buffers including non-core objects.

Additionally adding a feature to buffers (like scheduled buffers or a new buffer
type) would require again touching every single object.

## No controller

We could decide to offer only an open source library that translates the buffers
to pods that can be used by any autoscaler and get rid of the controller and the
translation layer.

### Why not?

*   Encapsulate the translation logic in a single controller that can be
    extended/replaced by the users if the need arises. Any autoscaler can work
    with a user extended controller as long as it gets the list of buffer pod
    specs from the buffer objects. This allows users to define buffers for their
    custom CRDs without changing the autoscaler in any way
*   Debuggability - splitting translation from provisioning of the capacity
    allows the user to inspect the buffer in a simple way to check the exact
    configuration it was translated into without deep diving into autoscaler
    logs which will differ depending on what autoscaler is used in the cluster.
*   Some future buffer types may not require autoscaler - there are ideas to add
    scheduler level reservations. We could configure a buffer to create an
    appropriate reservation underneath. Binding this logic to autoscaler does
    not feel right.

Note that while some of these arguments are not very strong the cost of having a
separate controller running as a subprocess in the autoscaler seems low and
therefore my proposal includes the controller.
