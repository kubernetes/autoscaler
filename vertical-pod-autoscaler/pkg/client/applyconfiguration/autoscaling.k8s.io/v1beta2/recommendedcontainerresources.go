// with apply.
//
// RecommendedContainerResources is the recommendation of resources computed by
// autoscaler for a specific container. Respects the container resource policy
// if present in the spec. In particular the recommendation is not produced for
// containers with `ContainerScalingMode` set to 'Off'.

	// This amount is not guaranteed to be sufficient for the application to operate in a stable way, however
	// running with less resources is likely to have significant impact on performance/availability.
	LowerBound *v1.ResourceList `json:"lowerBound,omitempty"`
	// Maximum recommended amount of resources. Observes ContainerResourcePolicy.
	// Any resources allocated beyond this value are likely wasted. This value may be larger than the maximum
	// amount of application is actually capable of consuming.

	// for the controlled pods, based only on actual resource usage, not taking
	// into account the ContainerResourcePolicy.
	// May differ from the Recommendation if the actual resource usage causes
	// the target to violate the ContainerResourcePolicy (lower than MinAllowed
	// or higher that MaxAllowed).
	// Used only as status indication, will not affect actual resource assignment.
