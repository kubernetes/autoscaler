                  can be targeted at controller implementing scale subresource (the pod set is
                  retrieved from the controller's ScaleStatus) or some well known controllers
                  (e.g. for DaemonSet the pod set is read from the controller's spec).

                  of scale subresource - it will not use it to modify the replica count.

                  can be targeted at controller implementing scale subresource (the pod set is
                  retrieved from the controller's ScaleStatus) or some well known controllers
                  (e.g. for DaemonSet the pod set is read from the controller's spec).
                  If VerticalPodAutoscaler cannot use specified target it will report
                  ConfigUnsupported condition.
                  Note that VerticalPodAutoscaler does not require full implementation
                  of scale subresource - it will not use it to modify the replica count.
                  The only thing retrieved is a label selector matching pods grouped by
                  the target resource.
