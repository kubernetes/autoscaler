## Intro

Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) frees users from the necessity of setting
up-to-date resource requests for the containers in their pods. When
configured, it will set the requests automatically based on usage and thus
allow proper scheduling onto nodes so that appropriate resource amount is
available for each pod. It will also maintain ratios between requests and
limits that were specified in initial containers configuration.

It can both down-scale pods that are over-requesting resources, and also
up-scale pods that are under-requesting resources based on their usage over
time.

Autoscaling is configured with a
[Custom Resource Definition object](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/)
called [VerticalPodAutoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/pkg/apis/autoscaling.k8s.io/v1/types.go).
It allows to specify which pods should be vertically autoscaled as well as if/how the
resource recommendations are applied.

To enable vertical pod autoscaling on your cluster please follow the installation
procedure described below.

## Getting Started

See [Installation](./docs/installation.md) for a guide on installation, followed by a the [Quick start](./docs/quickstart.md) guide.

Also refer to the [FAQ](./docs/faq.md) for more.

## Components and Architecture

The Vertical Pod Autoscaler consists of three parts. The recommender, updater and admission-controller. Read more about them on the [components](./docs/components.md) page.

## Features and Known limitations

You can also read about the [features](./docs/features.md) and [known limitations](./docs/known-limitations.md) of the VPA.
