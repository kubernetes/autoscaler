| `--log-file-max-size` | 1800 |                                          Defines the maximum size a log file can grow to (no effect when -logtostderr=true). Unit is megabytes. If the value is 0, the maximum file size is unlimited. |
| `--logtostderr` | true |                                                     log to standard error instead of files |

| `--one-output` |  |                                                      If true, only write logs to their native severity level (vs also writing to each lower severity level; no effect when -logtostderr=true) |
| `--pod-update-threshold` | 0.1 |                                      Ignore updates that have priority lower than the value of this flag |
| `--profiling` |  |                                                       Is debug/pprof endpoint enabled |

| `--stderrthreshold` |  |                                        set the log level threshold for writing to standard error |
| `--updater-interval` | 1m0s |                                       How often updater should run |
| `--use-admission-controller-status` | true |                                 If true, updater will only evict pods when admission controller status is valid. |
| `--v` | 4 | Set the log level verbosity |
| `--vmodule` |  |                                              comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging |
| `--vpa-object-namespace` |  |                                     Specifies the namespace to search for VPA objects. Leave empty to include all namespaces. If provided, the garbage collector will only clean this namespace. |
