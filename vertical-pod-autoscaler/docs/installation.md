## Notice on CRD update (>=1.0.0)

**NOTE:** In version 1.0.0, we have updated the CRD definition and added RBAC for the
status resource. If you are upgrading from version (<=0.14.0), you must update the CRD
definition and RBAC.

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/vpa-release-1.0/vertical-pod-autoscaler/deploy/vpa-v1-crd-gen.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/vpa-release-1.0/vertical-pod-autoscaler/deploy/vpa-rbac.yaml
```

Another method is to re-execute the ./hack/vpa-process-yamls.sh script.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler.git
cd autoscaler/vertical-pod-autoscaler
git checkout origin/vpa-release-1.0
REGISTRY=registry.k8s.io/autoscaling TAG=1.0.0 ./hack/vpa-process-yamls.sh apply
```

If you need to roll back to version (<=0.14.0), please check out the release for your
rollback version and execute ./hack/vpa-process-yamls.sh. For example, to rollback to 0.14.0:

```shell
git checkout origin/vpa-release-0.14
REGISTRY=registry.k8s.io/autoscaling TAG=0.14.0 ./hack/vpa-process-yamls.sh apply
kubectl delete clusterrole system:vpa-status-actor
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding system:vpa-status-actor
```

## Notice on deprecation of v1beta2 version (>=0.13.0)

**NOTE:** In 0.13.0 we deprecate `autoscaling.k8s.io/v1beta2` API. We plan to
remove this API version. While for now you can continue to use `v1beta2` API we
recommend using `autoscaling.k8s.io/v1` instead. `v1` and `v1beta2` APIs are
almost identical (`v1` API has some fields which are not present in `v1beta2`)
so simply changing which API version you're calling should be enough in almost
all cases.

## Notice on removal of v1beta1 version (>=0.5.0)

**NOTE:** In 0.5.0 we disabled the old version of the API - `autoscaling.k8s.io/v1beta1`.
The VPA objects in this version will no longer receive recommendations and
existing recommendations will be removed. The objects will remain present though
and a ConfigUnsupported condition will be set on them.

This doc is for installing latest VPA. For instructions on migration from older versions see [Migration Doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/MIGRATE.md).

## Prerequisites

- `kubectl` should be connected to the cluster you want to install VPA.
- The metrics server must be deployed in your cluster. Read more about [Metrics Server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server).
- If you are using a GKE Kubernetes cluster, you will need to grant your current Google
  identity `cluster-admin` role. Otherwise, you won't be authorized to grant extra
  privileges to the VPA system components.

  ```console
  $ gcloud info | grep Account    # get current google identity
  Account: [myname@example.org]

  $ kubectl create clusterrolebinding myname-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=myname@example.org
  Clusterrolebinding "myname-cluster-admin-binding" created
  ```

- If you already have another version of VPA installed in your cluster, you have to tear down
  the existing installation first with:

  ```console
  ./hack/vpa-down.sh
  ```

## Install command

To install VPA, please download the source code of VPA (for example with `git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler.git`)
and run the following command inside the `vertical-pod-autoscaler` directory:

```console
./hack/vpa-up.sh
```

Note: the script currently reads environment variables: `$REGISTRY` and `$TAG`.
Make sure you leave them unset unless you want to use a non-default version of VPA.

Note: If you are seeing following error during this step:

```console
unknown option -addext
```

please upgrade openssl to version 1.1.1 or higher (needs to support -addext option) or use ./hack/vpa-up.sh on the [0.8 release branch](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/vpa-release-0.8).

The script issues multiple `kubectl` commands to the
cluster that insert the configuration and start all needed pods (see
[architecture](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/autoscaling/vertical-pod-autoscaler.md#architecture-overview))
in the `kube-system` namespace. It also generates
and uploads a secret (a CA cert) used by VPA Admission Controller when communicating
with the API server.

To print YAML contents with all resources that would be understood by
`kubectl diff|apply|...` commands, you can use

```console
./hack/vpa-process-yamls.sh print
```

The output of that command won't include secret information generated by
[pkg/admission-controller/gencerts.sh](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/pkg/admission-controller/gencerts.sh) script.

## Tear down

Note that if you stop running VPA in your cluster, the resource requests
for the pods already modified by VPA will not change, but any new pods
will get resources as defined in your controllers (i.e. deployment or
replicaset) and not according to previous recommendations made by VPA.

To stop using Vertical Pod Autoscaling in your cluster:

- If running on GKE, clean up role bindings created in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites):

```console
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding myname-cluster-admin-binding
```

- Tear down VPA components:

```console
./hack/vpa-down.sh
```
